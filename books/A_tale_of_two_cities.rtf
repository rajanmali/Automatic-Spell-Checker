\par 
\par I. The Period
\par 
\par 
\par It was the best of times,
\par it was the worst of times,
\par it was the age of wisdom,
\par it was the age of foolishness,
\par it was the epoch of belief,
\par it was the epoch of incredulity,
\par it was the season of Light,
\par it was the season of Darkness,
\par it was the spring of hope,
\par it was the winter of despair,
\par we had everything before us,
\par we had nothing before us,
\par we were all going direct to Heaven,
\par we were all going direct the other way--
\par in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
\par its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
\par evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
\par 
\par There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
\par throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
\par a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
\par than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
\par that things in general were settled for ever.
\par 
\par It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
\par Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
\par as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
\par blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
\par heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
\par made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
\par ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
\par messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
\par deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
\par earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
\par from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
\par to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
\par communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
\par brood.
\par 
\par France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
\par sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
\par hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
\par Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
\par achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
\par torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
\par kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
\par which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
\par yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
\par Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
\par already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
\par boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
\par it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
\par of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
\par sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
\par rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
\par the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
\par the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
\par unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
\par with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
\par that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
\par 
\par In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
\par justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
\par highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
\par families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
\par their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman
\par in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
\par challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
\par "the Captain," gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
\par mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
\par then got shot dead himself by the other four, "in consequence of the
\par failure of his ammunition:" after which the mail was robbed in peace;
\par that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
\par and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
\par illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London
\par gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
\par fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
\par thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
\par Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search
\par for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
\par musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
\par much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
\par and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
\par up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
\par Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
\par hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
\par Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
\par and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of
\par sixpence.
\par 
\par All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
\par upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
\par Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
\par those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
\par fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
\par with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
\par and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
\par creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
\par roads that lay before them.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par II. The Mail
\par 
\par 
\par It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
\par before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.
\par The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
\par Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,
\par as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish
\par for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,
\par and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the
\par horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the
\par coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back
\par to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in
\par combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
\par otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals
\par are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to
\par their duty.
\par 
\par With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through
\par the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were
\par falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested
\par them and brought them to a stand, with a wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!" the
\par near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an
\par unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the
\par hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a
\par nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
\par 
\par There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
\par forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
\par none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the
\par air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the
\par waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out
\par everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,
\par and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
\par into it, as if they had made it all.
\par 
\par Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the
\par side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
\par ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from
\par anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was
\par hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from
\par the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers
\par were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on
\par the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,
\par when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in
\par "the Captain's" pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
\par non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard
\par of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
\par thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as
\par he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
\par and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
\par loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
\par deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
\par 
\par The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
\par the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they
\par all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but
\par the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
\par taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the
\par journey.
\par 
\par "Wo-ho!" said the coachman. "So, then! One more pull and you're at the
\par top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to
\par it!--Joe!"
\par 
\par "Halloa!" the guard replied.
\par 
\par "What o'clock do you make it, Joe?"
\par 
\par "Ten minutes, good, past eleven."
\par 
\par "My blood!" ejaculated the vexed coachman, "and not atop of Shooter's
\par yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!"
\par 
\par The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,
\par made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
\par suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its
\par passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach
\par stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three
\par had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
\par into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of
\par getting shot instantly as a highwayman.
\par 
\par The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses
\par stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
\par the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.
\par 
\par "Tst! Joe!" cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his
\par box.
\par 
\par "What do you say, Tom?"
\par 
\par They both listened.
\par 
\par "I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe."
\par 
\par "_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom," returned the guard, leaving his hold
\par of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. "Gentlemen! In the king's
\par name, all of you!"
\par 
\par With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on
\par the offensive.
\par 
\par The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;
\par the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He
\par remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained
\par in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,
\par and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked
\par back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up
\par his ears and looked back, without contradicting.
\par 
\par The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
\par of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
\par indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
\par the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the
\par passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the
\par quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding
\par the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.
\par 
\par The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.
\par 
\par "So-ho!" the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. "Yo there! Stand!
\par I shall fire!"
\par 
\par The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
\par a man's voice called from the mist, "Is that the Dover mail?"
\par 
\par "Never you mind what it is!" the guard retorted. "What are you?"
\par 
\par "_Is_ that the Dover mail?"
\par 
\par "Why do you want to know?"
\par 
\par "I want a passenger, if it is."
\par 
\par "What passenger?"
\par 
\par "Mr. Jarvis Lorry."
\par 
\par Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,
\par the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.
\par 
\par "Keep where you are," the guard called to the voice in the mist,
\par "because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in
\par your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight."
\par 
\par "What is the matter?" asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering
\par speech. "Who wants me? Is it Jerry?"
\par 
\par ("I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry," growled the guard to
\par himself. "He's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.")
\par 
\par "Yes, Mr. Lorry."
\par 
\par "What is the matter?"
\par 
\par "A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co."
\par 
\par "I know this messenger, guard," said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the
\par road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
\par passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and
\par pulled up the window. "He may come close; there's nothing wrong."
\par 
\par "I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that," said the
\par guard, in gruff soliloquy. "Hallo you!"
\par 
\par "Well! And hallo you!" said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.
\par 
\par "Come on at a footpace! d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that
\par saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil
\par at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So
\par now let's look at you."
\par 
\par The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,
\par and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider
\par stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger
\par a small folded paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and
\par rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
\par the man.
\par 
\par "Guard!" said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.
\par 
\par The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised
\par blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,
\par answered curtly, "Sir."
\par 
\par "There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You must
\par know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown
\par to drink. I may read this?"
\par 
\par "If so be as you're quick, sir."
\par 
\par He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and
\par read--first to himself and then aloud: "'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.'
\par It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED
\par TO LIFE."
\par 
\par Jerry started in his saddle. "That's a Blazing strange answer, too,"
\par said he, at his hoarsest.
\par 
\par "Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
\par well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night."
\par 
\par With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at
\par all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted
\par their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general
\par pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape
\par the hazard of originating any other kind of action.
\par 
\par The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
\par it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
\par in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and
\par having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,
\par looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a
\par few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was
\par furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
\par and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut
\par himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,
\par and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in
\par five minutes.
\par 
\par "Tom!" softly over the coach roof.
\par 
\par "Hallo, Joe."
\par 
\par "Did you hear the message?"
\par 
\par "I did, Joe."
\par 
\par "What did you make of it, Tom?"
\par 
\par "Nothing at all, Joe."
\par 
\par "That's a coincidence, too," the guard mused, "for I made the same of it
\par myself."
\par 
\par Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not
\par only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and
\par shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of
\par holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his
\par heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
\par hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the
\par hill.
\par 
\par "After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your
\par fore-legs till I get you on the level," said this hoarse messenger,
\par glancing at his mare. "'Recalled to life.' That's a Blazing strange
\par message. Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd
\par be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,
\par Jerry!"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par III. The Night Shadows
\par 
\par 
\par A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
\par constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A
\par solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every
\par one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
\par room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
\par heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of
\par its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the
\par awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I
\par turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time
\par to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable
\par water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses
\par of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the
\par book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
\par but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an
\par eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood
\par in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,
\par my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable
\par consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
\par individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In
\par any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there
\par a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
\par innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
\par 
\par As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the
\par messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
\par first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the
\par three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
\par coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had
\par been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the
\par breadth of a county between him and the next.
\par 
\par The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
\par ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his
\par own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that
\par assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with
\par no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they
\par were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too
\par far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like
\par a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
\par throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees. When he stopped
\par for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he
\par poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he
\par muffled again.
\par 
\par "No, Jerry, no!" said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.
\par "It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't
\par suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don't think he'd
\par been a drinking!"
\par 
\par His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several
\par times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,
\par which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
\par over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was
\par so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
\par wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might
\par have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.
\par 
\par While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
\par watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who
\par was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
\par night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such
\par shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.
\par They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.
\par 
\par What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon
\par its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,
\par likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms
\par their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.
\par 
\par Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank
\par passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what
\par lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,
\par and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special
\par jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little
\par coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the
\par bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great
\par stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,
\par and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with
\par all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then
\par the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable
\par stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a
\par little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among
\par them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them
\par safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.
\par 
\par But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach
\par (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was
\par always with him, there was another current of impression that never
\par ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one
\par out of a grave.
\par 
\par Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
\par was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
\par not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
\par years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,
\par and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,
\par defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
\par so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
\par and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
\par prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
\par spectre:
\par 
\par "Buried how long?"
\par 
\par The answer was always the same: "Almost eighteen years."
\par 
\par "You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"
\par 
\par "Long ago."
\par 
\par "You know that you are recalled to life?"
\par 
\par "They tell me so."
\par 
\par "I hope you care to live?"
\par 
\par "I can't say."
\par 
\par "Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?"
\par 
\par The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes
\par the broken reply was, "Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon."
\par Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,
\par "Take me to her." Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it
\par was, "I don't know her. I don't understand."
\par 
\par After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,
\par and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his
\par hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
\par hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The
\par passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the
\par reality of mist and rain on his cheek.
\par 
\par Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving
\par patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating
\par by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
\par of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the
\par real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express
\par sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out
\par of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost
\par it again.
\par 
\par "Buried how long?"
\par 
\par "Almost eighteen years."
\par 
\par "I hope you care to live?"
\par 
\par "I can't say."
\par 
\par Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two
\par passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm
\par securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two
\par slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again
\par slid away into the bank and the grave.
\par 
\par "Buried how long?"
\par 
\par "Almost eighteen years."
\par 
\par "You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"
\par 
\par "Long ago."
\par 
\par The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in
\par his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary
\par passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
\par shadows of the night were gone.
\par 
\par He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a
\par ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
\par last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
\par in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
\par upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
\par and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.
\par 
\par "Eighteen years!" said the passenger, looking at the sun. "Gracious
\par Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par IV. The Preparation
\par 
\par 
\par When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
\par the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his
\par custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey
\par from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
\par traveller upon.
\par 
\par By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be
\par congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
\par roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
\par and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather
\par like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out
\par of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and
\par muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.
\par 
\par "There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?"
\par 
\par "Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The
\par tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,
\par sir?"
\par 
\par "I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber."
\par 
\par "And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.
\par Show Concord! Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off
\par gentleman's boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)
\par Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!"
\par 
\par The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
\par mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
\par head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
\par Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,
\par all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another
\par drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all
\par loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord
\par and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a
\par brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large
\par square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to
\par his breakfast.
\par 
\par The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman
\par in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,
\par with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,
\par that he might have been sitting for his portrait.
\par 
\par Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a
\par loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,
\par as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
\par evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain
\par of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a
\par fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He
\par wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his
\par head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which
\par looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
\par His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,
\par was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
\par beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A
\par face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the
\par quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
\par their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and
\par reserved expression of Tellson's Bank. He had a healthy colour in his
\par cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.
\par But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were
\par principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps
\par second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.
\par 
\par Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,
\par Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,
\par and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:
\par 
\par "I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
\par time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a
\par gentleman from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know."
\par 
\par "Yes, sir. Tellson's Bank in London, sir?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par "Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
\par their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A
\par vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House."
\par 
\par "Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one."
\par 
\par "Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
\par sir?"
\par 
\par "Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last
\par from France."
\par 
\par "Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people's
\par time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir."
\par 
\par "I believe so."
\par 
\par "But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
\par Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen
\par years ago?"
\par 
\par "You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from
\par the truth."
\par 
\par "Indeed, sir!"
\par 
\par Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the
\par table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,
\par dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while
\par he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the
\par immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.
\par 
\par When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on
\par the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
\par from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine
\par ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
\par wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
\par destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and
\par brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong
\par a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
\par dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little
\par fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by
\par night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide
\par made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,
\par sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable
\par that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
\par 
\par As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
\par at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
\par again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud
\par too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting
\par his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,
\par digging, digging, in the live red coals.
\par 
\par A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
\par harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.
\par Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last
\par glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
\par ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
\par got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
\par street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.
\par 
\par He set down his glass untouched. "This is Mam'selle!" said he.
\par 
\par In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette
\par had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from
\par Tellson's.
\par 
\par "So soon?"
\par 
\par Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none
\par then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's
\par immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.
\par 
\par The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his
\par glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen
\par wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment.
\par It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black
\par horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and
\par oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
\par were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep
\par graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected
\par from them until they were dug out.
\par 
\par The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his
\par way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for
\par the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall
\par candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
\par the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,
\par and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As
\par his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden
\par hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and
\par a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth
\par it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
\par not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright
\par fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his
\par eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,
\par of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
\par Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
\par high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of
\par the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital
\par procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were
\par offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the
\par feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.
\par 
\par "Pray take a seat, sir." In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
\par little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.
\par 
\par "I kiss your hand, miss," said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier
\par date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.
\par 
\par "I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
\par some intelligence--or discovery--"
\par 
\par "The word is not material, miss; either word will do."
\par 
\par "--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so
\par long dead--"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
\par hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for
\par anybody in their absurd baskets!
\par 
\par "--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate
\par with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for
\par the purpose."
\par 
\par "Myself."
\par 
\par "As I was prepared to hear, sir."
\par 
\par She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a
\par pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
\par was than she. He made her another bow.
\par 
\par "I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
\par those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to
\par France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
\par me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,
\par during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection. The
\par gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to
\par beg the favour of his waiting for me here."
\par 
\par "I was happy," said Mr. Lorry, "to be entrusted with the charge. I shall
\par be more happy to execute it."
\par 
\par "Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me
\par by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
\par business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
\par nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
\par strong and eager interest to know what they are."
\par 
\par "Naturally," said Mr. Lorry. "Yes--I--"
\par 
\par After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
\par ears, "It is very difficult to begin."
\par 
\par He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young
\par forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty
\par and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,
\par as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing
\par shadow.
\par 
\par "Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?"
\par 
\par "Am I not?" Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with
\par an argumentative smile.
\par 
\par Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of
\par which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
\par deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
\par she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the
\par moment she raised her eyes again, went on:
\par 
\par "In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you
\par as a young English lady, Miss Manette?"
\par 
\par "If you please, sir."
\par 
\par "Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to
\par acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than
\par if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with
\par your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers."
\par 
\par "Story!"
\par 
\par He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,
\par in a hurry, "Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call
\par our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific
\par gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor."
\par 
\par "Not of Beauvais?"
\par 
\par "Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
\par gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
\par gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.
\par Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that
\par time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years."
\par 
\par "At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?"
\par 
\par "I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and
\par I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other
\par French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands.
\par In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
\par scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;
\par there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like
\par sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my
\par business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in
\par the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere
\par machine. To go on--"
\par 
\par "But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think"--the
\par curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--"that when I was
\par left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years,
\par it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
\par to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then
\par conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding
\par the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub
\par his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking
\par down into her face while she sat looking up into his.
\par 
\par "Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself
\par just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold
\par with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect
\par that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of
\par Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of
\par Tellson's House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance
\par of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
\par Mangle."
\par 
\par After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry
\par flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most
\par unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
\par before), and resumed his former attitude.
\par 
\par "So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your
\par regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died
\par when he did--Don't be frightened! How you start!"
\par 
\par She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.
\par 
\par "Pray," said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from
\par the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
\par him in so violent a tremble: "pray control your agitation--a matter of
\par business. As I was saying--"
\par 
\par Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:
\par 
\par "As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly
\par and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not
\par been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
\par trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
\par privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
\par to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the
\par privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
\par to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had
\par implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of
\par him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have
\par been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais."
\par 
\par "I entreat you to tell me more, sir."
\par 
\par "I will. I am going to. You can bear it?"
\par 
\par "I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
\par moment."
\par 
\par "You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That's good!" (Though
\par his manner was less satisfied than his words.) "A matter of business.
\par Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now
\par if this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,
\par had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
\par born--"
\par 
\par "The little child was a daughter, sir."
\par 
\par "A daughter. A-a-matter of business--don't be distressed. Miss, if the
\par poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,
\par that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
\par inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by
\par rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don't kneel! In
\par Heaven's name why should you kneel to me!"
\par 
\par "For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!"
\par 
\par "A--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact
\par business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly
\par mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
\par shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so
\par much more at my ease about your state of mind."
\par 
\par Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had
\par very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
\par his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she
\par communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.
\par 
\par "That's right, that's right. Courage! Business! You have business before
\par you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with
\par you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened
\par her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,
\par to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud
\par upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
\par heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years."
\par 
\par As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
\par flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have
\par been already tinged with grey.
\par 
\par "You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
\par they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new
\par discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--"
\par 
\par He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the
\par forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was
\par now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.
\par 
\par "But he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too
\par probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
\par Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
\par in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to
\par restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort."
\par 
\par A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a
\par low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,
\par 
\par "I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. "There, there,
\par there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.
\par You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair
\par sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side."
\par 
\par She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, "I have been free, I
\par have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!"
\par 
\par "Only one thing more," said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
\par wholesome means of enforcing her attention: "he has been found under
\par another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be
\par worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
\par know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
\par held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
\par because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,
\par anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all
\par events--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even
\par Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of
\par the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring
\par to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,
\par and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, 'Recalled to Life;'
\par which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn't notice a
\par word! Miss Manette!"
\par 
\par Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
\par sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
\par upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
\par branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he
\par feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
\par out loudly for assistance without moving.
\par 
\par A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to
\par be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some
\par extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most
\par wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,
\par or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the
\par inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
\par poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him
\par flying back against the nearest wall.
\par 
\par ("I really think this must be a man!" was Mr. Lorry's breathless
\par reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)
\par 
\par "Why, look at you all!" bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.
\par "Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring
\par at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don't you go and fetch
\par things? I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold
\par water, and vinegar, quick, I will."
\par 
\par There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she
\par softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and
\par gentleness: calling her "my precious!" and "my bird!" and spreading her
\par golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.
\par 
\par "And you in brown!" she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
\par "couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her
\par to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do
\par you call _that_ being a Banker?"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
\par answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
\par sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn
\par servants under the mysterious penalty of "letting them know" something
\par not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a
\par regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
\par upon her shoulder.
\par 
\par "I hope she will do well now," said Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!"
\par 
\par "I hope," said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
\par humility, "that you accompany Miss Manette to France?"
\par 
\par "A likely thing, too!" replied the strong woman. "If it was ever
\par intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
\par would have cast my lot in an island?"
\par 
\par This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to
\par consider it.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par V. The Wine-shop
\par 
\par 
\par A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The
\par accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
\par out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just
\par outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.
\par 
\par All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
\par idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular
\par stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
\par thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
\par had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
\par jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,
\par made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
\par women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
\par run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in
\par the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with
\par handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants'
\par mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;
\par others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and
\par there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
\par directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed
\par pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted
\par fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the
\par wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up
\par along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,
\par if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
\par presence.
\par 
\par A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,
\par and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There
\par was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a
\par special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part
\par of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the
\par luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,
\par shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen
\par together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been
\par most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
\par demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who
\par had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in
\par motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
\par hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
\par starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men
\par with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into
\par the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom
\par gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.
\par 
\par The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street
\par in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had
\par stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many
\par wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks
\par on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was
\par stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.
\par Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a
\par tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his
\par head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled
\par upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.
\par 
\par The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
\par street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.
\par 
\par And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary
\par gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was
\par heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
\par waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;
\par but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a
\par terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the
\par fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,
\par passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered
\par in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which
\par had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the
\par children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the
\par grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
\par was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out
\par of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
\par lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
\par paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
\par firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless
\par chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,
\par among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the
\par baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
\par bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
\par was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
\par chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
\par farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
\par drops of oil.
\par 
\par Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding
\par street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
\par diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
\par and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
\par that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
\par wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and
\par slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor
\par compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted
\par into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or
\par inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)
\par were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman
\par painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of
\par meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,
\par croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were
\par gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a
\par flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives
\par and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the
\par gunmaker's stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,
\par with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but
\par broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down
\par the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
\par rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across
\par the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
\par pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,
\par and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
\par manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and
\par the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.
\par 
\par For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
\par should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
\par long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling
\par up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
\par condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over
\par France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of
\par song and feather, took no warning.
\par 
\par The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its
\par appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
\par it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
\par for the lost wine. "It's not my affair," said he, with a final shrug
\par of the shoulders. "The people from the market did it. Let them bring
\par another."
\par 
\par There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,
\par he called to him across the way:
\par 
\par "Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?"
\par 
\par The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often
\par the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
\par often the way with his tribe too.
\par 
\par "What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?" said the wine-shop
\par keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of
\par mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. "Why do you write
\par in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place
\par to write such words in?"
\par 
\par In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,
\par perhaps not) upon the joker's heart. The joker rapped it with his
\par own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing
\par attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
\par hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
\par practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.
\par 
\par "Put it on, put it on," said the other. "Call wine, wine; and finish
\par there." With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's
\par dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
\par his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.
\par 
\par This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,
\par and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a
\par bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
\par His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
\par the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
\par crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good
\par eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on
\par the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
\par resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
\par down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
\par the man.
\par 
\par Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
\par came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with
\par a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
\par heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
\par manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might
\par have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
\par in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being
\par sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
\par shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large
\par earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick
\par her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported
\par by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but
\par coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting
\par of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
\par line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
\par shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
\par he stepped over the way.
\par 
\par The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
\par rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
\par a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
\par dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
\par of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the
\par elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, "This is our man."
\par 
\par "What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?" said Monsieur Defarge
\par to himself; "I don't know you."
\par 
\par But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
\par with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.
\par 
\par "How goes it, Jacques?" said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. "Is
\par all the spilt wine swallowed?"
\par 
\par "Every drop, Jacques," answered Monsieur Defarge.
\par 
\par When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,
\par picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,
\par and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
\par 
\par "It is not often," said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
\par Defarge, "that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
\par of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?"
\par 
\par "It is so, Jacques," Monsieur Defarge returned.
\par 
\par At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still
\par using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of
\par cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
\par 
\par The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
\par drinking vessel and smacked his lips.
\par 
\par "Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
\par always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I
\par right, Jacques?"
\par 
\par "You are right, Jacques," was the response of Monsieur Defarge.
\par 
\par This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment
\par when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and
\par slightly rustled in her seat.
\par 
\par "Hold then! True!" muttered her husband. "Gentlemen--my wife!"
\par 
\par The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three
\par flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
\par giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the
\par wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
\par of spirit, and became absorbed in it.
\par 
\par "Gentlemen," said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly
\par upon her, "good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you
\par wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the
\par fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
\par close to the left here," pointing with his hand, "near to the window of
\par my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been
\par there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!"
\par 
\par They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur
\par Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
\par gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.
\par 
\par "Willingly, sir," said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
\par the door.
\par 
\par Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first
\par word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had
\par not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then
\par beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge
\par knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.
\par 
\par Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
\par joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
\par company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
\par and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
\par by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
\par gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee
\par to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was
\par a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable
\par transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour
\par in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,
\par angry, dangerous man.
\par 
\par "It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly."
\par Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began
\par ascending the stairs.
\par 
\par "Is he alone?" the latter whispered.
\par 
\par "Alone! God help him, who should be with him!" said the other, in the
\par same low voice.
\par 
\par "Is he always alone, then?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par "Of his own desire?"
\par 
\par "Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they
\par found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be
\par discreet--as he was then, so he is now."
\par 
\par "He is greatly changed?"
\par 
\par "Changed!"
\par 
\par The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,
\par and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so
\par forcible. Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his
\par two companions ascended higher and higher.
\par 
\par Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
\par parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
\par indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation
\par within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,
\par the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
\par staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides
\par flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and
\par hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted
\par the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
\par intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost
\par insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt
\par and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to
\par his young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.
\par Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made
\par at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left
\par uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
\par to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were
\par caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer
\par or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any
\par promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.
\par 
\par At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
\par third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
\par and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
\par was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in
\par advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he
\par dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about
\par here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
\par his shoulder, took out a key.
\par 
\par "The door is locked then, my friend?" said Mr. Lorry, surprised.
\par 
\par "Ay. Yes," was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.
\par 
\par "You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?"
\par 
\par "I think it necessary to turn the key." Monsieur Defarge whispered it
\par closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.
\par 
\par "Why?"
\par 
\par "Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be
\par frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what
\par harm--if his door was left open."
\par 
\par "Is it possible!" exclaimed Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "Is it possible!" repeated Defarge, bitterly. "Yes. And a beautiful
\par world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things
\par are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under
\par that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on."
\par 
\par This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word
\par of it had reached the young lady's ears. But, by this time she trembled
\par under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,
\par and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent
\par on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.
\par 
\par "Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a
\par moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,
\par all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you
\par bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.
\par That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!"
\par 
\par They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were
\par soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at
\par once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at
\par the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which
\par the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing
\par footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed
\par themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
\par wine-shop.
\par 
\par "I forgot them in the surprise of your visit," explained Monsieur
\par Defarge. "Leave us, good boys; we have business here."
\par 
\par The three glided by, and went silently down.
\par 
\par There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
\par the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
\par Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:
\par 
\par "Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?"
\par 
\par "I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few."
\par 
\par "Is that well?"
\par 
\par "_I_ think it is well."
\par 
\par "Who are the few? How do you choose them?"
\par 
\par "I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the
\par sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another
\par thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment."
\par 
\par With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in
\par through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck
\par twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to
\par make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,
\par three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned
\par it as heavily as he could.
\par 
\par The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the
\par room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more
\par than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.
\par 
\par He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry
\par got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he
\par felt that she was sinking.
\par 
\par "A-a-a-business, business!" he urged, with a moisture that was not of
\par business shining on his cheek. "Come in, come in!"
\par 
\par "I am afraid of it," she answered, shuddering.
\par 
\par "Of it? What?"
\par 
\par "I mean of him. Of my father."
\par 
\par Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of
\par their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
\par shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her
\par down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.
\par 
\par Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
\par took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,
\par methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
\par could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to
\par where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.
\par 
\par The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim
\par and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the
\par roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
\par the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
\par other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this
\par door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.
\par Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it
\par was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
\par alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
\par requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being
\par done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
\par towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at
\par him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very
\par busy, making shoes.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par VI. The Shoemaker
\par 
\par 
\par "Good day!" said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that
\par bent low over the shoemaking.
\par 
\par It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
\par salutation, as if it were at a distance:
\par 
\par "Good day!"
\par 
\par "You are still hard at work, I see?"
\par 
\par After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the
\par voice replied, "Yes--I am working." This time, a pair of haggard eyes
\par had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.
\par 
\par The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the
\par faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
\par doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
\par the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo
\par of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and
\par resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
\par beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and
\par suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive
\par it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,
\par wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered
\par home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
\par 
\par Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked
\par up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical
\par perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were
\par aware of had stood, was not yet empty.
\par 
\par "I want," said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,
\par "to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?"
\par 
\par The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,
\par at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the
\par other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.
\par 
\par "What did you say?"
\par 
\par "You can bear a little more light?"
\par 
\par "I must bear it, if you let it in." (Laying the palest shadow of a
\par stress upon the second word.)
\par 
\par The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that
\par angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
\par showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his
\par labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
\par feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very
\par long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and
\par thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet
\par dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really
\par otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
\par His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body
\par to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose
\par stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion
\par from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of
\par parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.
\par 
\par He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones
\par of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
\par pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without
\par first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had
\par lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without
\par first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.
\par 
\par "Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?" asked Defarge,
\par motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.
\par 
\par "What did you say?"
\par 
\par "Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?"
\par 
\par "I can't say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don't know."
\par 
\par But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When
\par he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
\par looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
\par unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
\par it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
\par the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The
\par look and the action had occupied but an instant.
\par 
\par "You have a visitor, you see," said Monsieur Defarge.
\par 
\par "What did you say?"
\par 
\par "Here is a visitor."
\par 
\par The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his
\par work.
\par 
\par "Come!" said Defarge. "Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when
\par he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.
\par 
\par "Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name."
\par 
\par There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:
\par 
\par "I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?"
\par 
\par "I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's
\par information?"
\par 
\par "It is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe. It is in the
\par present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand." He
\par glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.
\par 
\par "And the maker's name?" said Defarge.
\par 
\par Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand
\par in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
\par hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and
\par so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission. The task of
\par recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
\par had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or
\par endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a
\par fast-dying man.
\par 
\par "Did you ask me for my name?"
\par 
\par "Assuredly I did."
\par 
\par "One Hundred and Five, North Tower."
\par 
\par "Is that all?"
\par 
\par "One Hundred and Five, North Tower."
\par 
\par With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work
\par again, until the silence was again broken.
\par 
\par "You are not a shoemaker by trade?" said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly
\par at him.
\par 
\par His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the
\par question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back
\par on the questioner when they had sought the ground.
\par 
\par "I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I
\par learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--"
\par 
\par He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his
\par hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face
\par from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and
\par resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a
\par subject of last night.
\par 
\par "I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
\par a long while, and I have made shoes ever since."
\par 
\par As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.
\par Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:
\par 
\par "Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?"
\par 
\par The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the
\par questioner.
\par 
\par "Monsieur Manette"; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; "do you
\par remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old
\par banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your
\par mind, Monsieur Manette?"
\par 
\par As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
\par Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
\par intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
\par through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded
\par again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And
\par so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
\par had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where
\par she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only
\par raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and
\par shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,
\par trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
\par breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression
\par repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it
\par looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.
\par 
\par Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and
\par less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
\par and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he
\par took the shoe up, and resumed his work.
\par 
\par "Have you recognised him, monsieur?" asked Defarge in a whisper.
\par 
\par "Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
\par unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
\par well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!"
\par 
\par She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
\par which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
\par figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
\par over his labour.
\par 
\par Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,
\par beside him, and he bent over his work.
\par 
\par It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument
\par in his hand, for his shoemaker's knife. It lay on that side of him
\par which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was
\par stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He
\par raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,
\par but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his
\par striking at her with the knife, though they had.
\par 
\par He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began
\par to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in
\par the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:
\par 
\par "What is this?"
\par 
\par With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her
\par lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she
\par laid his ruined head there.
\par 
\par "You are not the gaoler's daughter?"
\par 
\par She sighed "No."
\par 
\par "Who are you?"
\par 
\par Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
\par beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange
\par thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
\par laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.
\par 
\par Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed
\par aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and
\par little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action
\par he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his
\par shoemaking.
\par 
\par But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his
\par shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to
\par be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand
\par to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
\par attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained
\par a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden
\par hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.
\par 
\par He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. "It is
\par the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!"
\par 
\par As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to
\par become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the
\par light, and looked at her.
\par 
\par "She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned
\par out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was
\par brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. 'You will
\par leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they
\par may in the spirit.' Those were the words I said. I remember them very
\par well."
\par 
\par He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.
\par But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,
\par though slowly.
\par 
\par "How was this?--_Was it you_?"
\par 
\par Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a
\par frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only
\par said, in a low voice, "I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
\par us, do not speak, do not move!"
\par 
\par "Hark!" he exclaimed. "Whose voice was that?"
\par 
\par His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white
\par hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his
\par shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and
\par tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and
\par gloomily shook his head.
\par 
\par "No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can't be. See what the
\par prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face
\par she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He
\par was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your
\par name, my gentle angel?"
\par 
\par Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees
\par before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.
\par 
\par "O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,
\par and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I
\par cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may
\par tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless
\par me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!"
\par 
\par His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and
\par lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.
\par 
\par "If you hear in my voice--I don't know that it is so, but I hope it
\par is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
\par sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in
\par touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
\par breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when
\par I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you
\par with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the
\par remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,
\par weep for it, weep for it!"
\par 
\par She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a
\par child.
\par 
\par "If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
\par have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
\par peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
\par and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And
\par if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
\par and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
\par honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
\par striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
\par my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep
\par for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred
\par tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank
\par God for us, thank God!"
\par 
\par He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so
\par touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
\par had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.
\par 
\par When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving
\par breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
\par storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm
\par called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and
\par daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay
\par there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his
\par head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained
\par him from the light.
\par 
\par "If, without disturbing him," she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as
\par he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, "all could be
\par arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he
\par could be taken away--"
\par 
\par "But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?" asked Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
\par him."
\par 
\par "It is true," said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. "More
\par than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.
\par Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?"
\par 
\par "That's business," said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his
\par methodical manners; "and if business is to be done, I had better do it."
\par 
\par "Then be so kind," urged Miss Manette, "as to leave us here. You see how
\par composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me
\par now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from
\par interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,
\par as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until
\par you return, and then we will remove him straight."
\par 
\par Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and
\par in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage
\par and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,
\par for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
\par dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
\par to do it.
\par 
\par Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the
\par hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him. The darkness
\par deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed
\par through the chinks in the wall.
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and
\par had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and
\par meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the
\par lamp he carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the
\par garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and
\par assisted him to his feet.
\par 
\par No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in
\par the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,
\par whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that
\par he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They
\par tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to
\par answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for
\par the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of
\par occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen
\par in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
\par daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.
\par 
\par In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he
\par ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak
\par and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to
\par his daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand
\par in both his own.
\par 
\par They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.
\par Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps
\par of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and
\par round at the walls.
\par 
\par "You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?"
\par 
\par "What did you say?"
\par 
\par But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if
\par she had repeated it.
\par 
\par "Remember? No, I don't remember. It was so very long ago."
\par 
\par That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
\par prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,
\par "One Hundred and Five, North Tower;" and when he looked about him, it
\par evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed
\par him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
\par tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was
\par no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he
\par dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again.
\par 
\par No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the
\par many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural
\par silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and
\par that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
\par saw nothing.
\par 
\par The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
\par him, when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking,
\par miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame
\par Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
\par went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly
\par brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned
\par against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.
\par 
\par Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word "To the Barrier!" The
\par postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
\par over-swinging lamps.
\par 
\par Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better
\par streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,
\par illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
\par gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. "Your papers,
\par travellers!" "See here then, Monsieur the Officer," said Defarge,
\par getting down, and taking him gravely apart, "these are the papers of
\par monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with
\par him, at the--" He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the
\par military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
\par in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day
\par or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. "It is well.
\par Forward!" from the uniform. "Adieu!" from Defarge. And so, under a short
\par grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great
\par grove of stars.
\par 
\par Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
\par this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
\par rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
\par is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
\par All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
\par whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried
\par man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
\par lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:
\par 
\par "I hope you care to be recalled to life?"
\par 
\par And the old answer:
\par 
\par "I can't say."

\par I. Five Years Later
\par 
\par 
\par Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
\par year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very
\par dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,
\par moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
\par proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
\par proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence
\par in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if
\par it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was
\par no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
\par convenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted
\par no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no
\par embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but
\par Tellson's, thank Heaven--!
\par 
\par Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
\par question of rebuilding Tellson's. In this respect the House was much
\par on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
\par suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
\par objectionable, but were only the more respectable.
\par 
\par Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection
\par of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
\par a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps,
\par and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
\par counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
\par wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
\par windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,
\par and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
\par heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing
\par "the House," you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,
\par where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its
\par hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
\par twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden
\par drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
\par they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they
\par were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among
\par the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good
\par polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms
\par made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their
\par parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family
\par papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
\par dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year
\par one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you
\par by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released
\par from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads
\par exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
\par Abyssinia or Ashantee.
\par 
\par But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
\par with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's.
\par Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's?
\par Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note
\par was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the
\par purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder
\par of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to
\par Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of
\par three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to
\par Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it
\par might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
\par reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each
\par particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
\par after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business,
\par its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid
\par low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately
\par disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the
\par ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.
\par 
\par Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the
\par oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young
\par man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was
\par old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full
\par Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to
\par be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches
\par and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.
\par 
\par Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an
\par odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live
\par sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless
\par upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin
\par of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson's,
\par in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always
\par tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted
\par this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful
\par occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the
\par easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
\par appellation of Jerry.
\par 
\par The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,
\par Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March
\par morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself
\par always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under
\par the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a
\par popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were
\par but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
\par might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as
\par it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was
\par already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged
\par for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth
\par was spread.
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin
\par at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll
\par and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair
\par looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he
\par exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:
\par 
\par "Bust me, if she ain't at it agin!"
\par 
\par A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
\par corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
\par person referred to.
\par 
\par "What!" said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. "You're at it
\par agin, are you?"
\par 
\par After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at
\par the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the
\par odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that,
\par whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he
\par often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.
\par 
\par "What," said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his
\par mark--"what are you up to, Aggerawayter?"
\par 
\par "I was only saying my prayers."
\par 
\par "Saying your prayers! You're a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping
\par yourself down and praying agin me?"
\par 
\par "I was not praying against you; I was praying for you."
\par 
\par "You weren't. And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with. Here!
\par your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your
\par father's prosperity. You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
\par You've got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
\par herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out
\par of the mouth of her only child."
\par 
\par Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning
\par to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
\par board.
\par 
\par "And what do you suppose, you conceited female," said Mr. Cruncher, with
\par unconscious inconsistency, "that the worth of _your_ prayers may be?
\par Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!"
\par 
\par "They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than
\par that."
\par 
\par "Worth no more than that," repeated Mr. Cruncher. "They ain't worth
\par much, then. Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you. I can't
\par afford it. I'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If
\par you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and
\par child, and not in opposition to 'em. If I had had any but a unnat'ral
\par wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might
\par have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
\par countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.
\par B-u-u-ust me!" said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting
\par on his clothes, "if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and
\par another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
\par devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my
\par boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
\par then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I
\par tell you," here he addressed his wife once more, "I won't be gone agin,
\par in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as
\par laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if
\par it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet
\par I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've
\par been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
\par it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you
\par say now!"
\par 
\par Growling, in addition, such phrases as "Ah! yes! You're religious, too.
\par You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
\par and child, would you? Not you!" and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
\par from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook
\par himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.
\par In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,
\par and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father's did,
\par kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor
\par woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made
\par his toilet, with a suppressed cry of "You are going to flop, mother.
\par --Halloa, father!" and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in
\par again with an undutiful grin.
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his
\par breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular
\par animosity.
\par 
\par "Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?"
\par 
\par His wife explained that she had merely "asked a blessing."
\par 
\par "Don't do it!" said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected
\par to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions. "I
\par ain't a going to be blest out of house and home. I won't have my wittles
\par blest off my table. Keep still!"
\par 
\par Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party
\par which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried
\par his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed
\par inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled
\par aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as
\par he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation
\par of the day.
\par 
\par It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite
\par description of himself as "a honest tradesman." His stock consisted of
\par a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,
\par young Jerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to
\par beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,
\par with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
\par from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's
\par feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr.
\par Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar
\par itself,--and was almost as in-looking.
\par 
\par Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his
\par three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's,
\par Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
\par standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to
\par inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
\par boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,
\par extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic
\par in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two
\par eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
\par The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
\par the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
\par youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
\par in Fleet-street.
\par 
\par The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's
\par establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:
\par 
\par "Porter wanted!"
\par 
\par "Hooray, father! Here's an early job to begin with!"
\par 
\par Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on
\par the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
\par had been chewing, and cogitated.
\par 
\par "Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!" muttered young Jerry.
\par "Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don't get no iron
\par rust here!"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par II. A Sight
\par 
\par 
\par "You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?" said one of the oldest of
\par clerks to Jerry the messenger.
\par 
\par "Ye-es, sir," returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. "I _do_
\par know the Bailey."
\par 
\par "Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry."
\par 
\par "I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much
\par better," said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
\par in question, "than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey."
\par 
\par "Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
\par door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in."
\par 
\par "Into the court, sir?"
\par 
\par "Into the court."
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to
\par interchange the inquiry, "What do you think of this?"
\par 
\par "Am I to wait in the court, sir?" he asked, as the result of that
\par conference.
\par 
\par "I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
\par Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry's
\par attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,
\par to remain there until he wants you."
\par 
\par "Is that all, sir?"
\par 
\par "That's all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him
\par you are there."
\par 
\par As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
\par Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the
\par blotting-paper stage, remarked:
\par 
\par "I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?"
\par 
\par "Treason!"
\par 
\par "That's quartering," said Jerry. "Barbarous!"
\par 
\par "It is the law," remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised
\par spectacles upon him. "It is the law."
\par 
\par "It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It's hard enough to kill
\par him, but it's wery hard to spile him, sir."
\par 
\par "Not at all," retained the ancient clerk. "Speak well of the law. Take
\par care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
\par care of itself. I give you that advice."
\par 
\par "It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice," said Jerry. "I
\par leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is."
\par 
\par "Well, well," said the old clerk; "we all have our various ways of
\par gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry
\par ways. Here is the letter. Go along."
\par 
\par Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
\par deference than he made an outward show of, "You are a lean old one,
\par too," made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,
\par and went his way.
\par 
\par They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had
\par not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
\par But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
\par villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
\par into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
\par dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It
\par had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced
\par his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him.
\par For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,
\par from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on
\par a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a
\par half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
\par So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It
\par was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted
\par a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for
\par the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and
\par softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in
\par blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
\par leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
\par under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
\par illustration of the precept, that "Whatever is is right;" an aphorism
\par that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome
\par consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.
\par 
\par Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this
\par hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
\par way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in
\par his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play
\par at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the
\par former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey
\par doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the
\par criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.
\par 
\par After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
\par very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into
\par court.
\par 
\par "What's on?" he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next
\par to.
\par 
\par "Nothing yet."
\par 
\par "What's coming on?"
\par 
\par "The Treason case."
\par 
\par "The quartering one, eh?"
\par 
\par "Ah!" returned the man, with a relish; "he'll be drawn on a hurdle to
\par be half hanged, and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own
\par face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,
\par and then his head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters.
\par That's the sentence."
\par 
\par "If he's found Guilty, you mean to say?" Jerry added, by way of proviso.
\par 
\par "Oh! they'll find him guilty," said the other. "Don't you be afraid of
\par that."
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he
\par saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry
\par sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged
\par gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers
\par before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
\par in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him
\par then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
\par court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
\par with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up
\par to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
\par 
\par "What's _he_ got to do with the case?" asked the man he had spoken with.
\par 
\par "Blest if I know," said Jerry.
\par 
\par "What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?"
\par 
\par "Blest if I know that either," said Jerry.
\par 
\par The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
\par down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the
\par central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
\par went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.
\par 
\par Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
\par ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled
\par at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round
\par pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows
\par stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,
\par laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help
\par themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got
\par upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.
\par Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall
\par of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
\par whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with
\par the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,
\par that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him
\par in an impure mist and rain.
\par 
\par The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
\par five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and
\par a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly
\par dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and
\par dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out
\par of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express
\par itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his
\par situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the
\par soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,
\par bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.
\par 
\par The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,
\par was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less
\par horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage
\par details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his
\par fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
\par was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
\par and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various
\par spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and
\par powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.
\par 
\par Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to
\par an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that
\par he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
\par forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers
\par occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
\par King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and
\par so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of
\par our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
\par said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
\par evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
\par said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation
\par to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head
\par becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with
\par huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
\par the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood
\par there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and
\par that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.
\par 
\par The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,
\par beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from
\par the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and
\par attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
\par and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
\par composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
\par it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
\par vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.
\par 
\par Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
\par upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
\par it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together. Haunted
\par in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the
\par glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one
\par day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
\par for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind. Be
\par that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
\par of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his
\par face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.
\par 
\par It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court
\par which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat,
\par in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look
\par immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his
\par aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.
\par 
\par The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than
\par twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very
\par remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,
\par and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
\par but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he
\par looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as
\par it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a
\par handsome man, not past the prime of life.
\par 
\par His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by
\par him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her
\par dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had
\par been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
\par that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very
\par noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
\par had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about,
\par "Who are they?"
\par 
\par Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own
\par manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
\par absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about
\par him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
\par from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
\par to Jerry:
\par 
\par "Witnesses."
\par 
\par "For which side?"
\par 
\par "Against."
\par 
\par "Against what side?"
\par 
\par "The prisoner's."
\par 
\par The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,
\par leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was
\par in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the
\par axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par III. A Disappointment
\par 
\par 
\par Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
\par them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
\par claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the
\par public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or
\par even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the
\par prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and
\par repassing between France and England, on secret business of which
\par he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of
\par traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real
\par wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.
\par That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who
\par was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the
\par prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his
\par Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.
\par That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and
\par attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner's
\par friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
\par infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
\par in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues
\par were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public
\par benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as
\par they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,
\par as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well
\par knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;
\par whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
\par they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more
\par especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
\par That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
\par for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had
\par communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him
\par a holy determination to examine his master's table-drawers and pockets,
\par and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to
\par hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,
\par in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General's)
\par brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.
\par Attorney-General's) father and mother. That, he called with confidence
\par on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two
\par witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
\par produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
\par his Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by
\par sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
\par such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be
\par proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the
\par same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as
\par showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof
\par would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged
\par in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the
\par very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.
\par That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they
\par were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must
\par positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether
\par they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their
\par pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
\par their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion
\par of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that
\par there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon
\par pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off. That head
\par Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
\par everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith
\par of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
\par good as dead and gone.
\par 
\par When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
\par a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in
\par anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the
\par unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.
\par 
\par Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader's lead, examined the
\par patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was
\par exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if
\par it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom
\par of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
\par wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.
\par Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting
\par opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.
\par 
\par Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation.
\par What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn't
\par precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody's.
\par Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very
\par distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors'
\par prison? Didn't see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors'
\par prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three
\par times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever
\par been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?
\par Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell
\par downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at
\par dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
\par committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?
\par Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not
\par more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.
\par Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a
\par very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
\par No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more
\par about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.
\par Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government
\par pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear
\par no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer
\par patriotism? None whatever.
\par 
\par The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a
\par great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
\par simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
\par packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
\par He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
\par charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of
\par the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging
\par his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the
\par prisoner's pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from
\par the drawer of the prisoner's desk. He had not put them there first. He
\par had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
\par at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
\par Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given
\par information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
\par he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
\par only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
\par that was merely a coincidence. He didn't call it a particularly curious
\par coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a
\par curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He
\par was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.
\par 
\par The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis
\par Lorry.
\par 
\par "Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?"
\par 
\par "I am."
\par 
\par "On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and
\par seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and
\par Dover by the mail?"
\par 
\par "It did."
\par 
\par "Were there any other passengers in the mail?"
\par 
\par "Two."
\par 
\par "Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?"
\par 
\par "They did."
\par 
\par "Mr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?"
\par 
\par "I cannot undertake to say that he was."
\par 
\par "Does he resemble either of these two passengers?"
\par 
\par "Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so
\par reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that."
\par 
\par "Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as
\par those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to
\par render it unlikely that he was one of them?"
\par 
\par "No."
\par 
\par "You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?"
\par 
\par "No."
\par 
\par "So at least you say he may have been one of them?"
\par 
\par "Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like
\par myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous
\par air."
\par 
\par "Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?"
\par 
\par "I certainly have seen that."
\par 
\par "Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your
\par certain knowledge, before?"
\par 
\par "I have."
\par 
\par "When?"
\par 
\par "I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the
\par prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the
\par voyage with me."
\par 
\par "At what hour did he come on board?"
\par 
\par "At a little after midnight."
\par 
\par "In the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board
\par at that untimely hour?"
\par 
\par "He happened to be the only one."
\par 
\par "Never mind about 'happening,' Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who
\par came on board in the dead of the night?"
\par 
\par "He was."
\par 
\par "Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?"
\par 
\par "With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here."
\par 
\par "They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?"
\par 
\par "Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and
\par I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore."
\par 
\par "Miss Manette!"
\par 
\par The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now
\par turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and
\par kept her hand drawn through his arm.
\par 
\par "Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner."
\par 
\par To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was
\par far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
\par Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all
\par the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him
\par to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
\par before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts
\par to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
\par rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.
\par 
\par "Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?"
\par 
\par "Yes, sir."
\par 
\par "Where?"
\par 
\par "On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same
\par occasion."
\par 
\par "You are the young lady just now referred to?"
\par 
\par "O! most unhappily, I am!"
\par 
\par The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
\par of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: "Answer the questions put
\par to you, and make no remark upon them."
\par 
\par "Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
\par passage across the Channel?"
\par 
\par "Yes, sir."
\par 
\par "Recall it."
\par 
\par In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: "When the
\par gentleman came on board--"
\par 
\par "Do you mean the prisoner?" inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.
\par 
\par "Yes, my Lord."
\par 
\par "Then say the prisoner."
\par 
\par "When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father," turning
\par her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, "was much fatigued
\par and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was
\par afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
\par deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take
\par care of him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four.
\par The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could
\par shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I
\par had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would
\par set when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed
\par great gentleness and kindness for my father's state, and I am sure he
\par felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together."
\par 
\par "Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?"
\par 
\par "No."
\par 
\par "How many were with him?"
\par 
\par "Two French gentlemen."
\par 
\par "Had they conferred together?"
\par 
\par "They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
\par necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat."
\par 
\par "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?"
\par 
\par "Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don't know what
\par papers."
\par 
\par "Like these in shape and size?"
\par 
\par "Possibly, but indeed I don't know, although they stood whispering very
\par near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
\par light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they
\par spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that
\par they looked at papers."
\par 
\par "Now, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette."
\par 
\par "The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out
\par of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my
\par father. I hope," bursting into tears, "I may not repay him by doing him
\par harm to-day."
\par 
\par Buzzing from the blue-flies.
\par 
\par "Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
\par you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must
\par give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,
\par he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on."
\par 
\par "He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
\par difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was
\par therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business
\par had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,
\par take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long
\par time to come."
\par 
\par "Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular."
\par 
\par "He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said
\par that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on
\par England's part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
\par Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
\par Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
\par laughingly, and to beguile the time."
\par 
\par Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
\par a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
\par unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully
\par anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
\par she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
\par the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same
\par expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
\par of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
\par when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
\par heresy about George Washington.
\par 
\par Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it
\par necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's
\par father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.
\par 
\par "Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?"
\par 
\par "Once. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or
\par three years and a half ago."
\par 
\par "Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or
\par speak to his conversation with your daughter?"
\par 
\par "Sir, I can do neither."
\par 
\par "Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
\par either?"
\par 
\par He answered, in a low voice, "There is."
\par 
\par "Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without
\par trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?"
\par 
\par He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, "A long imprisonment."
\par 
\par "Were you newly released on the occasion in question?"
\par 
\par "They tell me so."
\par 
\par "Have you no remembrance of the occasion?"
\par 
\par "None. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what
\par time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the
\par time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
\par here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
\par my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become
\par familiar. I have no remembrance of the process."
\par 
\par Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down
\par together.
\par 
\par A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being
\par to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,
\par in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and
\par got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did
\par not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more,
\par to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness
\par was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required,
\par in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,
\par waiting for another person. The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining
\par this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner
\par on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
\par been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a
\par little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening
\par this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
\par attention and curiosity at the prisoner.
\par 
\par "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?"
\par 
\par The witness was quite sure.
\par 
\par "Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?"
\par 
\par Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.
\par 
\par "Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there," pointing
\par to him who had tossed the paper over, "and then look well upon the
\par prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?"
\par 
\par Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly
\par if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
\par not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
\par into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
\par his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
\par much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner's
\par counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned
\par friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he
\par would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might
\par happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
\par this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so
\par confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash
\par this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to
\par useless lumber.
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
\par fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr.
\par Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit
\par of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and
\par traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
\par scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look
\par rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,
\par and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
\par swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family
\par affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making
\par those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a
\par consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,
\par even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped
\par and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they
\par had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
\par gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
\par and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that
\par reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
\par impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
\par How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
\par attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
\par and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;
\par how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous
\par character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the
\par State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed
\par (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could
\par not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.
\par 
\par Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to
\par attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.
\par Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
\par Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
\par prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
\par the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole
\par decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.
\par 
\par And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.
\par 
\par Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
\par changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.
\par While his teamed friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him,
\par whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced
\par anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
\par grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,
\par and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
\par in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man
\par sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put
\par on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his
\par hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
\par day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him
\par a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he
\par undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,
\par when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the
\par lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would
\par hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the
\par observation to his next neighbour, and added, "I'd hold half a guinea
\par that _he_ don't get no law-work to do. Don't look like the sort of one
\par to get any, do he?"
\par 
\par Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
\par appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon
\par her father's breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:
\par "Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out.
\par Don't you see she will fall!"
\par 
\par There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much
\par sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to
\par him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown
\par strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or
\par brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,
\par ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a
\par moment, spoke, through their foreman.
\par 
\par They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George
\par Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,
\par but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,
\par and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in
\par the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the
\par jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get
\par refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat
\par down.
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out,
\par now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,
\par could easily get near him.
\par 
\par "Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the
\par way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don't be a moment
\par behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You
\par are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long
\par before I can."
\par 
\par Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in
\par acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up
\par at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.
\par 
\par "How is the young lady?"
\par 
\par "She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she
\par feels the better for being out of court."
\par 
\par "I'll tell the prisoner so. It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman
\par like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
\par in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.
\par The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all
\par eyes, ears, and spikes.
\par 
\par "Mr. Darnay!"
\par 
\par The prisoner came forward directly.
\par 
\par "You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She
\par will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation."
\par 
\par "I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so
\par for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?"
\par 
\par "Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it."
\par 
\par Mr. Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood,
\par half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.
\par 
\par "I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks."
\par 
\par "What," said Carton, still only half turned towards him, "do you expect,
\par Mr. Darnay?"
\par 
\par "The worst."
\par 
\par "It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their
\par withdrawing is in your favour."
\par 
\par Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
\par more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
\par in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above
\par them.
\par 
\par An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded
\par passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.
\par The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
\par refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
\par of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along
\par with them.
\par 
\par "Jerry! Jerry!" Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got
\par there.
\par 
\par "Here, sir! It's a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. "Quick! Have you got
\par it?"
\par 
\par "Yes, sir."
\par 
\par Hastily written on the paper was the word "ACQUITTED."
\par 
\par "If you had sent the message, 'Recalled to Life,' again," muttered
\par Jerry, as he turned, "I should have known what you meant, this time."
\par 
\par He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,
\par until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
\par with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
\par swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in
\par search of other carrion.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par IV. Congratulatory
\par 
\par 
\par From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
\par human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
\par Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
\par for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
\par Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
\par death.
\par 
\par It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
\par in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
\par shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him
\par twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
\par had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and
\par to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent
\par reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long
\par lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition
\par from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of
\par itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those
\par unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
\par Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three
\par hundred miles away.
\par 
\par Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
\par his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his
\par misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,
\par the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial
\par influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could
\par recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few
\par and slight, and she believed them over.
\par 
\par Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned
\par to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little
\par more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
\par loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
\par way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
\par conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.
\par 
\par He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his
\par late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean
\par out of the group: "I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.
\par Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the
\par less likely to succeed on that account."
\par 
\par "You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,"
\par said his late client, taking his hand.
\par 
\par "I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as
\par another man's, I believe."
\par 
\par It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, "Much better," Mr. Lorry
\par said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
\par object of squeezing himself back again.
\par 
\par "You think so?" said Mr. Stryver. "Well! you have been present all day,
\par and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too."
\par 
\par "And as such," quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
\par now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered
\par him out of it--"as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up
\par this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.
\par Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out."
\par 
\par "Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver; "I have a night's work to
\par do yet. Speak for yourself."
\par 
\par "I speak for myself," answered Mr. Lorry, "and for Mr. Darnay, and for
\par Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?"
\par He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.
\par 
\par His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
\par Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
\par not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his
\par thoughts had wandered away.
\par 
\par "My father," said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.
\par 
\par He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.
\par 
\par "Shall we go home, my father?"
\par 
\par With a long breath, he answered "Yes."
\par 
\par The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
\par impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be
\par released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the
\par passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,
\par and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of
\par gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
\par Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into
\par the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
\par departed in it.
\par 
\par Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
\par to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or
\par interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
\par against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
\par out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now
\par stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.
\par 
\par "So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?"
\par 
\par Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's
\par proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the
\par better for it in appearance.
\par 
\par "If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
\par business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
\par appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, "You have mentioned that before,
\par sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We
\par have to think of the House more than ourselves."
\par 
\par "_I_ know, _I_ know," rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. "Don't be
\par nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,
\par I dare say."
\par 
\par "And indeed, sir," pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, "I really don't
\par know what you have to do with the matter. If you'll excuse me, as very
\par much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your
\par business."
\par 
\par "Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business," said Mr. Carton.
\par 
\par "It is a pity you have not, sir."
\par 
\par "I think so, too."
\par 
\par "If you had," pursued Mr. Lorry, "perhaps you would attend to it."
\par 
\par "Lord love you, no!--I shouldn't," said Mr. Carton.
\par 
\par "Well, sir!" cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,
\par "business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,
\par if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
\par Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
\par for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!
\par I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
\par life.--Chair there!"
\par 
\par Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
\par Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. Carton,
\par who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
\par then, and turned to Darnay:
\par 
\par "This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must
\par be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
\par these street stones?"
\par 
\par "I hardly seem yet," returned Charles Darnay, "to belong to this world
\par again."
\par 
\par "I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far
\par advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly."
\par 
\par "I begin to think I _am_ faint."
\par 
\par "Then why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those
\par numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or
\par some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at."
\par 
\par Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to
\par Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were
\par shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
\par his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
\par opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port
\par before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.
\par 
\par "Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.
\par Darnay?"
\par 
\par "I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
\par mended as to feel that."
\par 
\par "It must be an immense satisfaction!"
\par 
\par He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large
\par one.
\par 
\par "As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
\par It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we
\par are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are
\par not much alike in any particular, you and I."
\par 
\par Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
\par this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was
\par at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.
\par 
\par "Now your dinner is done," Carton presently said, "why don't you call a
\par health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?"
\par 
\par "What health? What toast?"
\par 
\par "Why, it's on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I'll
\par swear it's there."
\par 
\par "Miss Manette, then!"
\par 
\par "Miss Manette, then!"
\par 
\par Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton
\par flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to
\par pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.
\par 
\par "That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!"
\par he said, filling his new goblet.
\par 
\par A slight frown and a laconic "Yes," were the answer.
\par 
\par "That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it
\par feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such
\par sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?"
\par 
\par Again Darnay answered not a word.
\par 
\par "She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not
\par that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was."
\par 
\par The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this
\par disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the
\par strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him
\par for it.
\par 
\par "I neither want any thanks, nor merit any," was the careless rejoinder.
\par "It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did
\par it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question."
\par 
\par "Willingly, and a small return for your good offices."
\par 
\par "Do you think I particularly like you?"
\par 
\par "Really, Mr. Carton," returned the other, oddly disconcerted, "I have
\par not asked myself the question."
\par 
\par "But ask yourself the question now."
\par 
\par "You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do."
\par 
\par "_I_ don't think I do," said Carton. "I begin to have a very good
\par opinion of your understanding."
\par 
\par "Nevertheless," pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, "there is
\par nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
\par parting without ill-blood on either side."
\par 
\par Carton rejoining, "Nothing in life!" Darnay rang. "Do you call the whole
\par reckoning?" said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, "Then
\par bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at
\par ten."
\par 
\par The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.
\par Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
\par of defiance in his manner, and said, "A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
\par I am drunk?"
\par 
\par "I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton."
\par 
\par "Think? You know I have been drinking."
\par 
\par "Since I must say so, I know it."
\par 
\par "Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I
\par care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me."
\par 
\par "Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better."
\par 
\par "May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don't let your sober face elate you,
\par however; you don't know what it may come to. Good night!"
\par 
\par When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a
\par glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.
\par 
\par "Do you particularly like the man?" he muttered, at his own image; "why
\par should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing
\par in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have
\par made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you
\par what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change
\par places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
\par he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and
\par have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow."
\par 
\par He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
\par minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the
\par table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par V. The Jackal
\par 
\par 
\par Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is
\par the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate
\par statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
\par in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a
\par perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
\par The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
\par learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.
\par Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
\par practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the
\par drier parts of the legal race.
\par 
\par A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had
\par begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
\par he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,
\par specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the
\par visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the
\par florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of
\par the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
\par among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.
\par 
\par It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
\par man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that
\par faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
\par among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments.
\par But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more
\par business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
\par pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
\par Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning.
\par 
\par Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great
\par ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,
\par might have floated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,
\par anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
\par at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there
\par they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was
\par rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
\par to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,
\par among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton
\par would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he
\par rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.
\par 
\par "Ten o'clock, sir," said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to
\par wake him--"ten o'clock, sir."
\par 
\par "_What's_ the matter?"
\par 
\par "Ten o'clock, sir."
\par 
\par "What do you mean? Ten o'clock at night?"
\par 
\par "Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you."
\par 
\par "Oh! I remember. Very well, very well."
\par 
\par After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man
\par dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,
\par he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,
\par and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's
\par Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.
\par 
\par The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
\par home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on,
\par and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He
\par had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
\par may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of
\par Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of
\par Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.
\par 
\par "You are a little late, Memory," said Stryver.
\par 
\par "About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later."
\par 
\par They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,
\par where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in
\par the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon
\par it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.
\par 
\par "You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney."
\par 
\par "Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day's client; or
\par seeing him dine--it's all one!"
\par 
\par "That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
\par identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?"
\par 
\par "I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have
\par been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck."
\par 
\par Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.
\par 
\par "You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work."
\par 
\par Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining
\par room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel
\par or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them
\par out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down
\par at the table, and said, "Now I am ready!"
\par 
\par "Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory," said Mr. Stryver,
\par gaily, as he looked among his papers.
\par 
\par "How much?"
\par 
\par "Only two sets of them."
\par 
\par "Give me the worst first."
\par 
\par "There they are, Sydney. Fire away!"
\par 
\par The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
\par drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
\par proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to
\par his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in
\par a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
\par his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some
\par lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,
\par so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
\par stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or
\par more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the
\par matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on
\par him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the
\par jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
\par no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
\par gravity.
\par 
\par At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
\par proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,
\par made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
\par assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
\par hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then
\par invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application
\par to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
\par this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
\par disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.
\par 
\par "And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch," said Mr.
\par Stryver.
\par 
\par The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming
\par again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.
\par 
\par "You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
\par to-day. Every question told."
\par 
\par "I always am sound; am I not?"
\par 
\par "I don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to
\par it and smooth it again."
\par 
\par With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.
\par 
\par "The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School," said Stryver, nodding
\par his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, "the
\par old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
\par now in despondency!"
\par 
\par "Ah!" returned the other, sighing: "yes! The same Sydney, with the same
\par luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own."
\par 
\par "And why not?"
\par 
\par "God knows. It was my way, I suppose."
\par 
\par He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
\par him, looking at the fire.
\par 
\par "Carton," said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
\par as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
\par was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney
\par Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, "your way
\par is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look
\par at me."
\par 
\par "Oh, botheration!" returned Sydney, with a lighter and more
\par good-humoured laugh, "don't _you_ be moral!"
\par 
\par "How have I done what I have done?" said Stryver; "how do I do what I
\par do?"
\par 
\par "Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth
\par your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to
\par do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind."
\par 
\par "I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?"
\par 
\par "I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were," said
\par Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.
\par 
\par "Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,"
\par pursued Carton, "you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
\par mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,
\par picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we
\par didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always
\par nowhere."
\par 
\par "And whose fault was that?"
\par 
\par "Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
\par driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
\par that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It's a gloomy
\par thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking.
\par Turn me in some other direction before I go."
\par 
\par "Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness," said Stryver, holding up
\par his glass. "Are you turned in a pleasant direction?"
\par 
\par Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.
\par 
\par "Pretty witness," he muttered, looking down into his glass. "I have had
\par enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?"
\par 
\par "The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette."
\par 
\par "_She_ pretty?"
\par 
\par "Is she not?"
\par 
\par "No."
\par 
\par "Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!"
\par 
\par "Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge
\par of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!"
\par 
\par "Do you know, Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,
\par and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: "do you know, I rather
\par thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
\par and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?"
\par 
\par "Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a
\par yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.
\par I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more drink;
\par I'll get to bed."
\par 
\par When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light
\par him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
\par windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the
\par dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a
\par lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
\par before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
\par the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.
\par 
\par Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still
\par on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the
\par wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
\par perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
\par from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
\par fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
\par A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
\par houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
\par pillow was wet with wasted tears.
\par 
\par Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
\par good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
\par incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
\par on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par VI. Hundreds of People
\par 
\par 
\par The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
\par far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the
\par waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
\par it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
\par Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
\par on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into
\par business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the
\par quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.
\par 
\par On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
\par the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
\par Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
\par secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with
\par them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
\par generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have
\par his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
\par Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
\par them.
\par 
\par A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be
\par found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of
\par the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
\par had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,
\par north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers
\par grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a
\par consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,
\par instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
\par settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which
\par the peaches ripened in their season.
\par 
\par The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
\par of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
\par though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
\par glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
\par place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
\par 
\par There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
\par there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
\par several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
\par audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
\par a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
\par rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
\par to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
\par who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if
\par he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all
\par visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
\par to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
\par a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
\par workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
\par about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
\par thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
\par required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
\par the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
\par from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.
\par 
\par Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
\par its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
\par His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
\par ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
\par he earned as much as he wanted.
\par 
\par These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and
\par notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
\par on the fine Sunday afternoon.
\par 
\par "Doctor Manette at home?"
\par 
\par Expected home.
\par 
\par "Miss Lucie at home?"
\par 
\par Expected home.
\par 
\par "Miss Pross at home?"
\par 
\par Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
\par anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the
\par fact.
\par 
\par "As I am at home myself," said Mr. Lorry, "I'll go upstairs."
\par 
\par Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her
\par birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
\par make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
\par agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off
\par by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,
\par that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the
\par rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,
\par the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
\par delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in
\par themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry
\par stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,
\par with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
\par time, whether he approved?
\par 
\par There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
\par communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
\par all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
\par he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was
\par the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books,
\par and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
\par the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
\par changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
\par Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's
\par bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
\par dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.
\par 
\par "I wonder," said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, "that he keeps
\par that reminder of his sufferings about him!"
\par 
\par "And why wonder at that?" was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.
\par 
\par It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
\par acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and
\par had since improved.
\par 
\par "I should have thought--" Mr. Lorry began.
\par 
\par "Pooh! You'd have thought!" said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.
\par 
\par "How do you do?" inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
\par express that she bore him no malice.
\par 
\par "I am pretty well, I thank you," answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; "how
\par are you?"
\par 
\par "Nothing to boast of," said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par "Indeed?"
\par 
\par "Ah! indeed!" said Miss Pross. "I am very much put out about my
\par Ladybird."
\par 
\par "Indeed?"
\par 
\par "For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll
\par fidget me to death," said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
\par stature) was shortness.
\par 
\par "Really, then?" said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.
\par 
\par "Really, is bad enough," returned Miss Pross, "but better. Yes, I am
\par very much put out."
\par 
\par "May I ask the cause?"
\par 
\par "I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to
\par come here looking after her," said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par "_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?"
\par 
\par "Hundreds," said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
\par time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
\par she exaggerated it.
\par 
\par "Dear me!" said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.
\par 
\par "I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
\par paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take
\par your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
\par for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it's really very hard,"
\par said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;
\par using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
\par fit anything.
\par 
\par "All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
\par are always turning up," said Miss Pross. "When you began it--"
\par 
\par "_I_ began it, Miss Pross?"
\par 
\par "Didn't you? Who brought her father to life?"
\par 
\par "Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--" said Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "It wasn't ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
\par enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
\par that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
\par him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
\par circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
\par and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
\par him), to take Ladybird's affections away from me."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
\par this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
\par unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
\par admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
\par it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
\par never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
\par their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there
\par is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
\par rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
\par respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
\par mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss
\par Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
\par better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's.
\par 
\par "There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird," said
\par Miss Pross; "and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a
\par mistake in life."
\par 
\par Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had
\par established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel
\par who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to
\par speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with
\par no touch of compunction. Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon
\par (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious
\par matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.
\par 
\par "As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
\par business," he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
\par sat down there in friendly relations, "let me ask you--does the Doctor,
\par in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?"
\par 
\par "Never."
\par 
\par "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?"
\par 
\par "Ah!" returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. "But I don't say he don't
\par refer to it within himself."
\par 
\par "Do you believe that he thinks of it much?"
\par 
\par "I do," said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par "Do you imagine--" Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up
\par short with:
\par 
\par "Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all."
\par 
\par "I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
\par sometimes?"
\par 
\par "Now and then," said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par "Do you suppose," Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his
\par bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, "that Doctor Manette has any
\par theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
\par the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
\par oppressor?"
\par 
\par "I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me."
\par 
\par "And that is--?"
\par 
\par "That she thinks he has."
\par 
\par "Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a
\par mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business."
\par 
\par "Dull?" Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.
\par 
\par Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, "No, no,
\par no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor
\par Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
\par he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,
\par though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
\par intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
\par attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss
\par Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
\par zealous interest."
\par 
\par "Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell
\par me," said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, "he is afraid
\par of the whole subject."
\par 
\par "Afraid?"
\par 
\par "It's plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It's a dreadful
\par remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not
\par knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
\par feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn't make the
\par subject pleasant, I should think."
\par 
\par It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. "True," said
\par he, "and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss
\par Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression
\par always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
\par it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence."
\par 
\par "Can't be helped," said Miss Pross, shaking her head. "Touch that
\par string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.
\par In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in
\par the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
\par up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to
\par know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in
\par his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up
\par and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says
\par a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it
\par best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down
\par together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
\par brought him to himself."
\par 
\par Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a
\par perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
\par in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
\par her possessing such a thing.
\par 
\par The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
\par had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
\par seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
\par set it going.
\par 
\par "Here they are!" said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
\par "and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!"
\par 
\par It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
\par peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,
\par looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied
\par they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
\par the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
\par heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
\par at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross
\par was ready at the street door to receive them.
\par 
\par Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
\par off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
\par with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
\par folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with
\par as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
\par had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant
\par sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
\par her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do
\par playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
\par chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
\par them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
\par eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
\par have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
\par beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
\par stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no
\par Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain
\par for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.
\par 
\par Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of
\par the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
\par always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
\par quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
\par contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
\par better. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical
\par kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
\par impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
\par impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters
\par of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
\par who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,
\par or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
\par a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
\par pleased.
\par 
\par On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days
\par persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
\par regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
\par which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,
\par Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts
\par to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.
\par 
\par It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
\par wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
\par there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
\par they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
\par the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some
\par time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
\par plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs
\par and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
\par whispered to them in its own way above their heads.
\par 
\par Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
\par presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
\par was only One.
\par 
\par Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross
\par suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
\par retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this
\par disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, "a fit of the
\par jerks."
\par 
\par The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The
\par resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as
\par they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
\par his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
\par likeness.
\par 
\par He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
\par vivacity. "Pray, Doctor Manette," said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the
\par plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
\par which happened to be the old buildings of London--"have you seen much of
\par the Tower?"
\par 
\par "Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of
\par it, to know that it teems with interest; little more."
\par 
\par "_I_ have been there, as you remember," said Darnay, with a smile,
\par though reddening a little angrily, "in another character, and not in a
\par character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
\par curious thing when I was there."
\par 
\par "What was that?" Lucie asked.
\par 
\par "In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
\par had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of
\par its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
\par prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone
\par in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
\par execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with
\par some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.
\par At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
\par examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or
\par legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
\par were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested
\par that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The
\par floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
\par earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
\par the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
\par or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he
\par had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler."
\par 
\par "My father," exclaimed Lucie, "you are ill!"
\par 
\par He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and
\par his look quite terrified them all.
\par 
\par "No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
\par made me start. We had better go in."
\par 
\par He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large
\par drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he
\par said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
\par of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
\par either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned
\par towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
\par when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.
\par 
\par He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of
\par his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
\par steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
\par was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
\par that the rain had startled him.
\par 
\par Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon
\par her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he
\par made only Two.
\par 
\par The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
\par windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was
\par done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
\par heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton
\par leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of
\par the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the
\par ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.
\par 
\par "The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few," said Doctor
\par Manette. "It comes slowly."
\par 
\par "It comes surely," said Carton.
\par 
\par They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a
\par dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.
\par 
\par There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
\par get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes
\par resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a
\par footstep was there.
\par 
\par "A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!" said Darnay, when they had
\par listened for a while.
\par 
\par "Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?" asked Lucie. "Sometimes, I have
\par sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of
\par a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
\par solemn--"
\par 
\par "Let us shudder too. We may know what it is."
\par 
\par "It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we
\par originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
\par sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made
\par the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
\par by-and-bye into our lives."
\par 
\par "There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,"
\par Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.
\par 
\par The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
\par rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
\par as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
\par coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
\par the distant streets, and not one within sight.
\par 
\par "Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or
\par are we to divide them among us?"
\par 
\par "I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
\par asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
\par then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
\par into my life, and my father's."
\par 
\par "I take them into mine!" said Carton. "_I_ ask no questions and make no
\par stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,
\par and I see them--by the Lightning." He added the last words, after there
\par had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.
\par 
\par "And I hear them!" he added again, after a peal of thunder. "Here they
\par come, fast, fierce, and furious!"
\par 
\par It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
\par for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
\par lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's
\par interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at
\par midnight.
\par 
\par The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when
\par Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set
\par forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches
\par of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
\par of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was
\par usually performed a good two hours earlier.
\par 
\par "What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry," said Mr. Lorry, "to
\par bring the dead out of their graves."
\par 
\par "I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don't expect to--what
\par would do that," answered Jerry.
\par 
\par "Good night, Mr. Carton," said the man of business. "Good night, Mr.
\par Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!"
\par 
\par Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,
\par bearing down upon them, too.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par VII. Monseigneur in Town
\par 
\par 
\par Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
\par fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
\par his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
\par the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
\par was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many
\par things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
\par rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could not so
\par much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
\par strong men besides the Cook.
\par 
\par Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
\par Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
\par pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
\par conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips. One lacquey carried
\par the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed
\par the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;
\par a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold
\par watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to
\par dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
\par place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon
\par his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
\par men; he must have died of two.
\par 
\par Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy
\par and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at
\par a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so
\par impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far
\par more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
\par state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance
\par for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly
\par favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted
\par days of the merry Stuart who sold it.
\par 
\par Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which
\par was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
\par business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
\par his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and
\par particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world
\par was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original
\par by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: "The earth and the fulness
\par thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur."
\par 
\par Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
\par his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of
\par affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances
\par public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and
\par must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances
\par private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after
\par generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
\par Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
\par time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
\par wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
\par poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with
\par a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer
\par rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior
\par mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked
\par down upon him with the loftiest contempt.
\par 
\par A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his
\par stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
\par waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
\par forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial
\par relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality
\par among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.
\par 
\par For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with
\par every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
\par achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any
\par reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
\par so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
\par equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
\par have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have
\par been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers
\par destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;
\par civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the
\par worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;
\par all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in
\par pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
\par Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
\par anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the
\par score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,
\par yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives
\par passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were
\par no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
\par for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly
\par patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had
\par discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
\par State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
\par root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
\par they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
\par Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
\par card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
\par Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this
\par wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
\par the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been
\par since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
\par subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of
\par exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various
\par notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
\par among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half
\par of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among
\par the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and
\par appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of
\par bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far
\par towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing
\par known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,
\par and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
\par supped as at twenty.
\par 
\par The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
\par upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
\par people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
\par things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting
\par them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
\par sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
\par whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
\par spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
\par Future, for Monseigneur's guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
\par three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
\par jargon about "the Centre of Truth:" holding that Man had got out of the
\par Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
\par out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of
\par the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
\par by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
\par discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
\par became manifest.
\par 
\par But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
\par Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been
\par ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally
\par correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such
\par delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant
\par swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would
\par surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen
\par of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
\par languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
\par and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
\par fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
\par his devouring hunger far away.
\par 
\par Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
\par things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
\par was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through
\par Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals
\par of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball
\par descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was
\par required to officiate "frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,
\par and white silk stockings." At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a
\par rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
\par Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call
\par him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at
\par Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
\par of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled
\par hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would
\par see the very stars out!
\par 
\par Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
\par chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
\par open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and
\par fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in
\par body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have
\par been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never
\par troubled it.
\par 
\par Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one
\par happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably
\par passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of
\par Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due
\par course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
\par sprites, and was seen no more.
\par 
\par The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
\par and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
\par but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
\par and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
\par way out.
\par 
\par "I devote you," said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
\par and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, "to the Devil!"
\par 
\par With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
\par dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.
\par 
\par He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and
\par with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every
\par feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
\par beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top
\par of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little
\par change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing
\par colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
\par by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of
\par treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with
\par attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
\par line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much
\par too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a
\par handsome face, and a remarkable one.
\par 
\par Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and
\par drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had
\par stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer
\par in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable
\par to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and
\par often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were
\par charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
\par check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had
\par sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,
\par that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician
\par custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
\par barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second
\par time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
\par left to get out of their difficulties as they could.
\par 
\par With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of
\par consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage
\par dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming
\par before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
\par its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
\par wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a
\par number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
\par 
\par But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have
\par stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded
\par behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,
\par and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.
\par 
\par "What has gone wrong?" said Monsieur, calmly looking out.
\par 
\par A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
\par the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was
\par down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.
\par 
\par "Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!" said a ragged and submissive man, "it is
\par a child."
\par 
\par "Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?"
\par 
\par "Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes."
\par 
\par The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
\par into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly
\par got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
\par Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.
\par 
\par "Killed!" shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
\par their length above his head, and staring at him. "Dead!"
\par 
\par The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was
\par nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
\par and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the
\par people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
\par remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
\par and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes
\par over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.
\par 
\par He took out his purse.
\par 
\par "It is extraordinary to me," said he, "that you people cannot take care
\par of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in
\par the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give
\par him that."
\par 
\par He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
\par craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The
\par tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, "Dead!"
\par 
\par He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest
\par made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,
\par sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were
\par stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They
\par were as silent, however, as the men.
\par 
\par "I know all, I know all," said the last comer. "Be a brave man, my
\par Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to
\par live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour
\par as happily?"
\par 
\par "You are a philosopher, you there," said the Marquis, smiling. "How do
\par they call you?"
\par 
\par "They call me Defarge."
\par 
\par "Of what trade?"
\par 
\par "Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine."
\par 
\par "Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine," said the Marquis,
\par throwing him another gold coin, "and spend it as you will. The horses
\par there; are they right?"
\par 
\par Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the
\par Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the
\par air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had
\par paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly
\par disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.
\par 
\par "Hold!" said Monsieur the Marquis. "Hold the horses! Who threw that?"
\par 
\par He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a
\par moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
\par the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
\par figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
\par 
\par "You dogs!" said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,
\par except as to the spots on his nose: "I would ride over any of you very
\par willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal
\par threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he
\par should be crushed under the wheels."
\par 
\par So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of
\par what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not
\par a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.
\par But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the
\par Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his
\par contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he
\par leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word "Go on!"
\par 
\par He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
\par succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
\par Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
\par whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
\par had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking
\par on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the
\par spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through
\par which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and
\par bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle
\par while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running
\par of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who
\par had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness
\par of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
\par into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,
\par time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together
\par in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all
\par things ran their course.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par VIII. Monseigneur in the Country
\par 
\par 
\par A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
\par Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
\par and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
\par inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
\par tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
\par disposition to give up, and wither away.
\par 
\par Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been
\par lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up
\par a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was
\par no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
\par occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting
\par sun.
\par 
\par The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
\par gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. "It will
\par die out," said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, "directly."
\par 
\par In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
\par heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
\par hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
\par quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow
\par left when the drag was taken off.
\par 
\par But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
\par at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a
\par church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a
\par fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects
\par as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
\par coming near home.
\par 
\par The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor
\par tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor
\par fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All
\par its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,
\par shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the
\par fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of
\par the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,
\par were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
\par for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be
\par paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
\par the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.
\par 
\par Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,
\par their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest
\par terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;
\par or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.
\par 
\par Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions'
\par whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as
\par if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in
\par his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
\par fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
\par He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow
\par sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the
\par meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
\par truth through the best part of a hundred years.
\par 
\par Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
\par drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before
\par Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces
\par drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender
\par of the roads joined the group.
\par 
\par "Bring me hither that fellow!" said the Marquis to the courier.
\par 
\par The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round
\par to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.
\par 
\par "I passed you on the road?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road."
\par 
\par "Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, it is true."
\par 
\par "What did you look at, so fixedly?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, I looked at the man."
\par 
\par He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
\par carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.
\par 
\par "What man, pig? And why look there?"
\par 
\par "Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag."
\par 
\par "Who?" demanded the traveller.
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, the man."
\par 
\par "May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You
\par know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?"
\par 
\par "Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of
\par all the days of my life, I never saw him."
\par 
\par "Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?"
\par 
\par "With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.
\par His head hanging over--like this!"
\par 
\par He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his
\par face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered
\par himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.
\par 
\par "What was he like?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
\par white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!"
\par 
\par The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
\par eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
\par the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
\par conscience.
\par 
\par "Truly, you did well," said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
\par vermin were not to ruffle him, "to see a thief accompanying my carriage,
\par and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur
\par Gabelle!"
\par 
\par Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
\par united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
\par examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
\par official manner.
\par 
\par "Bah! Go aside!" said Monsieur Gabelle.
\par 
\par "Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
\par to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle."
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders."
\par 
\par "Did he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?"
\par 
\par The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
\par particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some
\par half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and
\par presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.
\par 
\par "Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
\par a person plunges into the river."
\par 
\par "See to it, Gabelle. Go on!"
\par 
\par The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
\par wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
\par to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
\par they might not have been so fortunate.
\par 
\par The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
\par rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
\par it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
\par sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
\par gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
\par points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
\par courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.
\par 
\par At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,
\par with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor
\par figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had
\par studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was
\par dreadfully spare and thin.
\par 
\par To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
\par growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She
\par turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and
\par presented herself at the carriage-door.
\par 
\par "It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition."
\par 
\par With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
\par Monseigneur looked out.
\par 
\par "How, then! What is it? Always petitions!"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester."
\par 
\par "What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He
\par cannot pay something?"
\par 
\par "He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead."
\par 
\par "Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?"
\par 
\par "Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor
\par grass."
\par 
\par "Well?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?"
\par 
\par "Again, well?"
\par 
\par She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate
\par grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together
\par with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,
\par caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to
\par feel the appealing touch.
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of
\par want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want."
\par 
\par "Again, well? Can I feed them?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition is,
\par that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed
\par over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly
\par forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I
\par shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they
\par are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur!
\par Monseigneur!"
\par 
\par The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into
\par a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far
\par behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
\par diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
\par his chateau.
\par 
\par The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as
\par the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
\par at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid
\par of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his
\par man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they
\par could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
\par in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
\par stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
\par been extinguished.
\par 
\par The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,
\par was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged
\par for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door
\par of his chateau was opened to him.
\par 
\par "Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, not yet."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par IX. The Gorgon's Head
\par 
\par 
\par It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
\par with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of
\par staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony
\par business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and
\par stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in
\par all directions. As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was
\par finished, two centuries ago.
\par 
\par Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau
\par preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness
\par to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
\par of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the
\par flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
\par door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being
\par in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl's voice there was none,
\par save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of
\par those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then
\par heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.
\par 
\par The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a
\par hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;
\par grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a
\par peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord
\par was angry.
\par 
\par Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,
\par Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up
\par the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him
\par to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two
\par others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon
\par the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries
\par befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.
\par The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
\par break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
\par but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
\par pages in the history of France.
\par 
\par A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
\par room, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers. A small
\par lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
\par closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
\par black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.
\par 
\par "My nephew," said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; "they
\par said he was not arrived."
\par 
\par Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.
\par 
\par "Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the
\par table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour."
\par 
\par In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his
\par sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and
\par he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his
\par lips, when he put it down.
\par 
\par "What is that?" he calmly asked, looking with attention at the
\par horizontal lines of black and stone colour.
\par 
\par "Monseigneur? That?"
\par 
\par "Outside the blinds. Open the blinds."
\par 
\par It was done.
\par 
\par "Well?"
\par 
\par "Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are
\par here."
\par 
\par The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into
\par the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round
\par for instructions.
\par 
\par "Good," said the imperturbable master. "Close them again."
\par 
\par That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was
\par half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,
\par hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the
\par front of the chateau.
\par 
\par "Ask who is arrived."
\par 
\par It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind
\par Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance
\par rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.
\par He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.
\par 
\par He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and
\par there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.
\par He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.
\par 
\par Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake
\par hands.
\par 
\par "You left Paris yesterday, sir?" he said to Monseigneur, as he took his
\par seat at table.
\par 
\par "Yesterday. And you?"
\par 
\par "I come direct."
\par 
\par "From London?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par "You have been a long time coming," said the Marquis, with a smile.
\par 
\par "On the contrary; I come direct."
\par 
\par "Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
\par intending the journey."
\par 
\par "I have been detained by"--the nephew stopped a moment in his
\par answer--"various business."
\par 
\par "Without doubt," said the polished uncle.
\par 
\par So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.
\par When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,
\par looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
\par fine mask, opened a conversation.
\par 
\par "I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
\par took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
\par a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
\par sustained me."
\par 
\par "Not to death," said the uncle; "it is not necessary to say, to death."
\par 
\par "I doubt, sir," returned the nephew, "whether, if it had carried me to
\par the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there."
\par 
\par The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight
\par lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a
\par graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good
\par breeding that it was not reassuring.
\par 
\par "Indeed, sir," pursued the nephew, "for anything I know, you may have
\par expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
\par circumstances that surrounded me."
\par 
\par "No, no, no," said the uncle, pleasantly.
\par 
\par "But, however that may be," resumed the nephew, glancing at him with
\par deep distrust, "I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,
\par and would know no scruple as to means."
\par 
\par "My friend, I told you so," said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the
\par two marks. "Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago."
\par 
\par "I recall it."
\par 
\par "Thank you," said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.
\par 
\par His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical
\par instrument.
\par 
\par "In effect, sir," pursued the nephew, "I believe it to be at once your
\par bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
\par France here."
\par 
\par "I do not quite understand," returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
\par "Dare I ask you to explain?"
\par 
\par "I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not
\par been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would
\par have sent me to some fortress indefinitely."
\par 
\par "It is possible," said the uncle, with great calmness. "For the honour
\par of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
\par Pray excuse me!"
\par 
\par "I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
\par yesterday was, as usual, a cold one," observed the nephew.
\par 
\par "I would not say happily, my friend," returned the uncle, with refined
\par politeness; "I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for
\par consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence
\par your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
\par yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,
\par at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle
\par aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that
\par might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest
\par and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted
\par (comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such
\par things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right
\par of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such
\par dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),
\par one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing
\par some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have
\par lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the
\par assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as
\par to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very
\par bad!"
\par 
\par The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
\par as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
\par containing himself, that great means of regeneration.
\par 
\par "We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern
\par time also," said the nephew, gloomily, "that I believe our name to be
\par more detested than any name in France."
\par 
\par "Let us hope so," said the uncle. "Detestation of the high is the
\par involuntary homage of the low."
\par 
\par "There is not," pursued the nephew, in his former tone, "a face I can
\par look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
\par deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery."
\par 
\par "A compliment," said the Marquis, "to the grandeur of the family,
\par merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
\par Hah!" And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
\par crossed his legs.
\par 
\par But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes
\par thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
\par him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,
\par and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of
\par indifference.
\par 
\par "Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear
\par and slavery, my friend," observed the Marquis, "will keep the dogs
\par obedient to the whip, as long as this roof," looking up to it, "shuts
\par out the sky."
\par 
\par That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the
\par chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
\par they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
\par him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
\par the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof
\par he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new
\par way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
\par was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.
\par 
\par "Meanwhile," said the Marquis, "I will preserve the honour and repose
\par of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
\par terminate our conference for the night?"
\par 
\par "A moment more."
\par 
\par "An hour, if you please."
\par 
\par "Sir," said the nephew, "we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits
\par of wrong."
\par 
\par "_We_ have done wrong?" repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,
\par and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.
\par 
\par "Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account
\par to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father's time, we did
\par a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and
\par our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father's time,
\par when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint
\par inheritor, and next successor, from himself?"
\par 
\par "Death has done that!" said the Marquis.
\par 
\par "And has left me," answered the nephew, "bound to a system that is
\par frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to
\par execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last
\par look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to
\par redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain."
\par 
\par "Seeking them from me, my nephew," said the Marquis, touching him on the
\par breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--"you
\par will for ever seek them in vain, be assured."
\par 
\par Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was
\par cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking
\par quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he
\par touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of
\par a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the
\par body, and said,
\par 
\par "My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
\par lived."
\par 
\par When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his
\par box in his pocket.
\par 
\par "Better to be a rational creature," he added then, after ringing a small
\par bell on the table, "and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,
\par Monsieur Charles, I see."
\par 
\par "This property and France are lost to me," said the nephew, sadly; "I
\par renounce them."
\par 
\par "Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It
\par is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?"
\par 
\par "I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
\par to me from you, to-morrow--"
\par 
\par "Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable."
\par 
\par "--or twenty years hence--"
\par 
\par "You do me too much honour," said the Marquis; "still, I prefer that
\par supposition."
\par 
\par "--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to
\par relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!"
\par 
\par "Hah!" said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.
\par 
\par "To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,
\par under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,
\par mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,
\par and suffering."
\par 
\par "Hah!" said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.
\par 
\par "If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better
\par qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the
\par weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave
\par it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in
\par another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse
\par on it, and on all this land."
\par 
\par "And you?" said the uncle. "Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new
\par philosophy, graciously intend to live?"
\par 
\par "I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at
\par their backs, may have to do some day--work."
\par 
\par "In England, for example?"
\par 
\par "Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
\par family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other."
\par 
\par The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be
\par lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The
\par Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
\par valet.
\par 
\par "England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
\par prospered there," he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
\par with a smile.
\par 
\par "I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may
\par be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge."
\par 
\par "They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You
\par know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par "With a daughter?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par "Yes," said the Marquis. "You are fatigued. Good night!"
\par 
\par As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
\par in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
\par which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same
\par time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin
\par straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that
\par looked handsomely diabolic.
\par 
\par "Yes," repeated the Marquis. "A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
\par commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!"
\par 
\par It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
\par outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew
\par looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.
\par 
\par "Good night!" said the uncle. "I look to the pleasure of seeing you
\par again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his
\par chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will," he
\par added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his
\par valet to his own bedroom.
\par 
\par The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his
\par loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still
\par night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no
\par noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some
\par enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose
\par periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just
\par coming on.
\par 
\par He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the
\par scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow
\par toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the
\par prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at
\par the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
\par chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
\par the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
\par tall man with his arms up, crying, "Dead!"
\par 
\par "I am cool now," said Monsieur the Marquis, "and may go to bed."
\par 
\par So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin
\par gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence
\par with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.
\par 
\par The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
\par for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
\par rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
\par very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
\par the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
\par hardly ever to say what is set down for them.
\par 
\par For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
\par stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
\par dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
\par The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
\par were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
\par have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
\par taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
\par the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
\par the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
\par freed.
\par 
\par The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain
\par at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the
\par minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark
\par hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,
\par and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.
\par 
\par Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
\par trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water
\par of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces
\par crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the
\par weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur
\par the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
\par At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open
\par mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.
\par 
\par Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement
\par windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
\par shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely
\par lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the
\par fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
\par and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows
\par out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church
\par and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter
\par prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
\par foot.
\par 
\par The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and
\par surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been
\par reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;
\par now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked
\par round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
\par doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs
\par pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.
\par 
\par All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
\par return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
\par chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried
\par figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
\par everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?
\par 
\par What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
\par at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not
\par much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to
\par peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
\par to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or
\par no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,
\par down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the
\par fountain.
\par 
\par All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about
\par in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other
\par emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought
\par in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
\par on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
\par trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
\par the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
\par all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
\par on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
\par highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated
\par into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
\par himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,
\par and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind
\par a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle
\par (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of
\par the German ballad of Leonora?
\par 
\par It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.
\par 
\par The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
\par the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
\par through about two hundred years.
\par 
\par It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
\par mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the
\par heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
\par was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:
\par 
\par "Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par X. Two Promises
\par 
\par 
\par More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles
\par Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French
\par language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he
\par would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with
\par young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
\par living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for
\par its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in
\par sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not
\par at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
\par to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
\par dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a
\par tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and
\par profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
\par work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became
\par known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the
\par circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.
\par So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.
\par 
\par In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
\par to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he
\par would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and
\par did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.
\par 
\par A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
\par read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
\par contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
\par and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in
\par London.
\par 
\par Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days
\par when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
\par invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a
\par woman.
\par 
\par He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never
\par heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;
\par he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
\par confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
\par him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination
\par at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
\par long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
\par mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so
\par much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.
\par 
\par That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a
\par summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
\par he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
\par of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer
\par day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.
\par 
\par He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy
\par which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
\par their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a
\par very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
\par of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was
\par sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the
\par exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
\par frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.
\par 
\par He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
\par ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at
\par sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.
\par 
\par "Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your
\par return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were
\par both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due."
\par 
\par "I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter," he answered,
\par a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. "Miss
\par Manette--"
\par 
\par "Is well," said the Doctor, as he stopped short, "and your return will
\par delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will
\par soon be home."
\par 
\par "Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her
\par being from home, to beg to speak to you."
\par 
\par There was a blank silence.
\par 
\par "Yes?" said the Doctor, with evident constraint. "Bring your chair here,
\par and speak on."
\par 
\par He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less
\par easy.
\par 
\par "I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,"
\par so he at length began, "for some year and a half, that I hope the topic
\par on which I am about to touch may not--"
\par 
\par He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he
\par had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:
\par 
\par "Is Lucie the topic?"
\par 
\par "She is."
\par 
\par "It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me
\par to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay."
\par 
\par "It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor
\par Manette!" he said deferentially.
\par 
\par There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:
\par 
\par "I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it."
\par 
\par His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
\par originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
\par Darnay hesitated.
\par 
\par "Shall I go on, sir?"
\par 
\par Another blank.
\par 
\par "Yes, go on."
\par 
\par "You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
\par I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
\par the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
\par laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
\par disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love
\par her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!"
\par 
\par The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
\par ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
\par and cried:
\par 
\par "Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!"
\par 
\par His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles
\par Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had
\par extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter
\par so received it, and remained silent.
\par 
\par "I ask your pardon," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
\par moments. "I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it."
\par 
\par He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
\par raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
\par overshadowed his face:
\par 
\par "Have you spoken to Lucie?"
\par 
\par "No."
\par 
\par "Nor written?"
\par 
\par "Never."
\par 
\par "It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
\par to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
\par you."
\par 
\par He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.
\par 
\par "I know," said Darnay, respectfully, "how can I fail to know, Doctor
\par Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
\par you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
\par belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
\par can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
\par child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
\par with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
\par is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
\par itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
\par now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
\par years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
\par early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if
\par you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
\par hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
\par in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to
\par you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
\par neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
\par own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
\par loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
\par have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home."
\par 
\par Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a
\par little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.
\par 
\par "Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
\par with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
\par long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
\par now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
\par your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.
\par Heaven is my witness that I love her!"
\par 
\par "I believe it," answered her father, mournfully. "I have thought so
\par before now. I believe it."
\par 
\par "But, do not believe," said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice
\par struck with a reproachful sound, "that if my fortune were so cast as
\par that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time
\par put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a
\par word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I
\par should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at
\par a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
\par heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not
\par now touch this honoured hand."
\par 
\par He laid his own upon it as he spoke.
\par 
\par "No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like
\par you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
\par you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
\par in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
\par life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide
\par with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
\par come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be."
\par 
\par His touch still lingered on her father's hand. Answering the touch for a
\par moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of
\par his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
\par conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
\par occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.
\par 
\par "You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank
\par you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have
\par you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?"
\par 
\par "None. As yet, none."
\par 
\par "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
\par ascertain that, with my knowledge?"
\par 
\par "Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
\par might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow."
\par 
\par "Do you seek any guidance from me?"
\par 
\par "I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it
\par in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some."
\par 
\par "Do you seek any promise from me?"
\par 
\par "I do seek that."
\par 
\par "What is it?"
\par 
\par "I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
\par understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
\par innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I
\par could retain no place in it against her love for her father."
\par 
\par "If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?"
\par 
\par "I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's
\par favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,
\par Doctor Manette," said Darnay, modestly but firmly, "I would not ask that
\par word, to save my life."
\par 
\par "I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
\par well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
\par delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
\par respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
\par heart."
\par 
\par "May I ask, sir, if you think she is--" As he hesitated, her father
\par supplied the rest.
\par 
\par "Is sought by any other suitor?"
\par 
\par "It is what I meant to say."
\par 
\par Her father considered a little before he answered:
\par 
\par "You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
\par occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these."
\par 
\par "Or both," said Darnay.
\par 
\par "I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want
\par a promise from me. Tell me what it is."
\par 
\par "It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own
\par part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will
\par bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you
\par may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
\par me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The
\par condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
\par require, I will observe immediately."
\par 
\par "I give the promise," said the Doctor, "without any condition. I believe
\par your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I
\par believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
\par between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me
\par that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.
\par If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--"
\par 
\par The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
\par the Doctor spoke:
\par 
\par "--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
\par new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility
\par thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her
\par sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
\par than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk."
\par 
\par So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
\par his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
\par hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.
\par 
\par "You said something to me," said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.
\par "What was it you said to me?"
\par 
\par He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
\par condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:
\par 
\par "Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
\par part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is
\par not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and
\par why I am in England."
\par 
\par "Stop!" said the Doctor of Beauvais.
\par 
\par "I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no
\par secret from you."
\par 
\par "Stop!"
\par 
\par For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
\par another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.
\par 
\par "Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie
\par should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you
\par promise?"
\par 
\par "Willingly.
\par 
\par "Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she
\par should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!"
\par 
\par It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
\par darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
\par Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
\par reading-chair empty.
\par 
\par "My father!" she called to him. "Father dear!"
\par 
\par Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his
\par bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
\par his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
\par blood all chilled, "What shall I do! What shall I do!"
\par 
\par Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at
\par his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of
\par her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down
\par together for a long time.
\par 
\par She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He
\par slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished
\par work, were all as usual.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XI. A Companion Picture
\par 
\par 
\par "Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
\par jackal; "mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you."
\par 
\par Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,
\par and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
\par a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in
\par of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
\par arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
\par November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
\par bring grist to the mill again.
\par 
\par Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
\par application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him
\par through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
\par the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
\par his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
\par intervals for the last six hours.
\par 
\par "Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?" said Stryver the portly, with
\par his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
\par his back.
\par 
\par "I am."
\par 
\par "Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
\par surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
\par shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry."
\par 
\par "_Do_ you?"
\par 
\par "Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?"
\par 
\par "I don't feel disposed to say much. Who is she?"
\par 
\par "Guess."
\par 
\par "Do I know her?"
\par 
\par "Guess."
\par 
\par "I am not going to guess, at five o'clock in the morning, with my brains
\par frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask
\par me to dinner."
\par 
\par "Well then, I'll tell you," said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
\par posture. "Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
\par because you are such an insensible dog."
\par 
\par "And you," returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, "are such a
\par sensitive and poetical spirit--"
\par 
\par "Come!" rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, "though I don't prefer
\par any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still
\par I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_."
\par 
\par "You are a luckier, if you mean that."
\par 
\par "I don't mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--"
\par 
\par "Say gallantry, while you are about it," suggested Carton.
\par 
\par "Well! I'll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man," said Stryver,
\par inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, "who cares more to
\par be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
\par to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do."
\par 
\par "Go on," said Sydney Carton.
\par 
\par "No; but before I go on," said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
\par way, "I'll have this out with you. You've been at Doctor Manette's house
\par as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your
\par moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
\par hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,
\par Sydney!"
\par 
\par "It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to
\par be ashamed of anything," returned Sydney; "you ought to be much obliged
\par to me."
\par 
\par "You shall not get off in that way," rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
\par rejoinder at him; "no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you
\par to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
\par fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow."
\par 
\par Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.
\par 
\par "Look at me!" said Stryver, squaring himself; "I have less need to make
\par myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
\par Why do I do it?"
\par 
\par "I never saw you do it yet," muttered Carton.
\par 
\par "I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
\par get on."
\par 
\par "You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,"
\par answered Carton, with a careless air; "I wish you would keep to that. As
\par to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?"
\par 
\par He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.
\par 
\par "You have no business to be incorrigible," was his friend's answer,
\par delivered in no very soothing tone.
\par 
\par "I have no business to be, at all, that I know of," said Sydney Carton.
\par "Who is the lady?"
\par 
\par "Now, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,
\par Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
\par for the disclosure he was about to make, "because I know you don't mean
\par half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I
\par make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
\par me in slighting terms."
\par 
\par "I did?"
\par 
\par "Certainly; and in these chambers."
\par 
\par Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;
\par drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.
\par 
\par "You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young
\par lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
\par delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a
\par little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
\par You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I
\par think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of
\par a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
\par of mine, who had no ear for music."
\par 
\par Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
\par looking at his friend.
\par 
\par "Now you know all about it, Syd," said Mr. Stryver. "I don't care about
\par fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to
\par please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She
\par will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
\par and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her,
\par but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?"
\par 
\par Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, "Why should I be
\par astonished?"
\par 
\par "You approve?"
\par 
\par Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, "Why should I not approve?"
\par 
\par "Well!" said his friend Stryver, "you take it more easily than I fancied
\par you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
\par be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
\par ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had
\par enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I
\par feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
\par inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel
\par that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
\par credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
\par say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you
\par know; you really are in a bad way. You don't know the value of money,
\par you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
\par you really ought to think about a nurse."
\par 
\par The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as
\par big as he was, and four times as offensive.
\par 
\par "Now, let me recommend you," pursued Stryver, "to look it in the face.
\par I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,
\par you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of
\par you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor
\par understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
\par respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,
\par or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. That's the
\par kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney."
\par 
\par "I'll think of it," said Sydney.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XII. The Fellow of Delicacy
\par 
\par 
\par Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
\par fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known
\par to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental
\par debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as
\par well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange
\par at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
\par before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
\par and Hilary.
\par 
\par As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly
\par saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly
\par grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a
\par plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the
\par plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for
\par the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to
\par consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer
\par case could be.
\par 
\par Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal
\par proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to
\par Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
\par himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.
\par 
\par Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,
\par while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.
\par Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet
\par on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way
\par along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have
\par seen how safe and strong he was.
\par 
\par His way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and
\par knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.
\par Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness
\par of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
\par in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient
\par cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.
\par Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
\par bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
\par under the clouds were a sum.
\par 
\par "Halloa!" said Mr. Stryver. "How do you do? I hope you are well!"
\par 
\par It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
\par place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks
\par in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
\par squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading
\par the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
\par the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.
\par 
\par The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would
\par recommend under the circumstances, "How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do
\par you do, sir?" and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner
\par of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook
\par hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a
\par self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.
\par 
\par "Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?" asked Mr. Lorry, in his
\par business character.
\par 
\par "Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
\par have come for a private word."
\par 
\par "Oh indeed!" said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed
\par to the House afar off.
\par 
\par "I am going," said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
\par desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
\par be not half desk enough for him: "I am going to make an offer of myself
\par in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry."
\par 
\par "Oh dear me!" cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
\par visitor dubiously.
\par 
\par "Oh dear me, sir?" repeated Stryver, drawing back. "Oh dear you, sir?
\par What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?"
\par 
\par "My meaning," answered the man of business, "is, of course, friendly and
\par appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
\par my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.
\par Stryver--" Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest
\par manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,
\par "you know there really is so much too much of you!"
\par 
\par "Well!" said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
\par opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, "if I understand you,
\par Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
\par end, and bit the feather of a pen.
\par 
\par "D--n it all, sir!" said Stryver, staring at him, "am I not eligible?"
\par 
\par "Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!" said Mr. Lorry. "If you say
\par eligible, you are eligible."
\par 
\par "Am I not prosperous?" asked Stryver.
\par 
\par "Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous," said Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "And advancing?"
\par 
\par "If you come to advancing you know," said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be
\par able to make another admission, "nobody can doubt that."
\par 
\par "Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?" demanded Stryver,
\par perceptibly crestfallen.
\par 
\par "Well! I--Were you going there now?" asked Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "Straight!" said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.
\par 
\par "Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you."
\par 
\par "Why?" said Stryver. "Now, I'll put you in a corner," forensically
\par shaking a forefinger at him. "You are a man of business and bound to
\par have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?"
\par 
\par "Because," said Mr. Lorry, "I wouldn't go on such an object without
\par having some cause to believe that I should succeed."
\par 
\par "D--n _me_!" cried Stryver, "but this beats everything."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
\par Stryver.
\par 
\par "Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_
\par a Bank," said Stryver; "and having summed up three leading reasons for
\par complete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his
\par head on!" Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
\par been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.
\par 
\par "When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and
\par when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of
\par causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young
\par lady, my good sir," said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, "the
\par young lady. The young lady goes before all."
\par 
\par "Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver, squaring his
\par elbows, "that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
\par present in question is a mincing Fool?"
\par 
\par "Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver," said Mr. Lorry,
\par reddening, "that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
\par from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose
\par taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could
\par not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
\par this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my
\par mind."
\par 
\par The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's
\par blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;
\par Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
\par no better state now it was his turn.
\par 
\par "That is what I mean to tell you, sir," said Mr. Lorry. "Pray let there
\par be no mistake about it."
\par 
\par Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
\par hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the
\par toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:
\par 
\par "This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not
\par to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench
\par bar?"
\par 
\par "Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?"
\par 
\par "Yes, I do."
\par 
\par "Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly."
\par 
\par "And all I can say of it is," laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, "that
\par this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come."
\par 
\par "Now understand me," pursued Mr. Lorry. "As a man of business, I am
\par not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
\par business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
\par Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and
\par of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have
\par spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I
\par may not be right?"
\par 
\par "Not I!" said Stryver, whistling. "I can't undertake to find third
\par parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense
\par in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's
\par new to me, but you are right, I dare say."
\par 
\par "What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And
\par understand me, sir," said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, "I
\par will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any
\par gentleman breathing."
\par 
\par "There! I beg your pardon!" said Stryver.
\par 
\par "Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
\par painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
\par Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
\par painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You
\par know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with
\par the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
\par in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
\par little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
\par it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
\par soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
\par with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
\par best spared. What do you say?"
\par 
\par "How long would you keep me in town?"
\par 
\par "Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the
\par evening, and come to your chambers afterwards."
\par 
\par "Then I say yes," said Stryver: "I won't go up there now, I am not so
\par hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
\par in to-night. Good morning."
\par 
\par Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
\par concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it
\par bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
\par of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were
\par always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly
\par believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in
\par the empty office until they bowed another customer in.
\par 
\par The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
\par gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
\par moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
\par swallow, he got it down. "And now," said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
\par forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, "my way
\par out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong."
\par 
\par It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
\par great relief. "You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady," said Mr.
\par Stryver; "I'll do that for you."
\par 
\par Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,
\par Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
\par purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
\par the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
\par altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.
\par 
\par "Well!" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
\par bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. "I have been to
\par Soho."
\par 
\par "To Soho?" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. "Oh, to be sure! What am I
\par thinking of!"
\par 
\par "And I have no doubt," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was right in the
\par conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my
\par advice."
\par 
\par "I assure you," returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, "that I
\par am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's
\par account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
\par us say no more about it."
\par 
\par "I don't understand you," said Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "I dare say not," rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and
\par final way; "no matter, no matter."
\par 
\par "But it does matter," Mr. Lorry urged.
\par 
\par "No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there was
\par sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is
\par not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is
\par done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have
\par repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish
\par aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been
\par a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am
\par glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing
\par for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could
\par have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not
\par proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means
\par certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to
\par that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and
\par giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you
\par will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,
\par I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
\par And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
\par and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;
\par you were right, it never would have done."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
\par Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
\par showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
\par "Make the best of it, my dear sir," said Stryver; "say no more about it;
\par thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver
\par was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.
\par

\par 
\par XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy
\par 
\par 
\par If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
\par house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,
\par and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he
\par cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
\par which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
\par pierced by the light within him.
\par 
\par And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
\par and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night
\par he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
\par transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
\par figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
\par of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
\par in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time
\par brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
\par into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known
\par him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
\par it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
\par neighbourhood.
\par 
\par On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
\par that "he had thought better of that marrying matter") had carried his
\par delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
\par City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
\par for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod
\par those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became
\par animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,
\par they took him to the Doctor's door.
\par 
\par He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had
\par never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little
\par embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at
\par his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed
\par a change in it.
\par 
\par "I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!"
\par 
\par "No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What
\par is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?"
\par 
\par "Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to
\par live no better life?"
\par 
\par "God knows it is a shame!"
\par 
\par "Then why not change it?"
\par 
\par Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that
\par there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
\par answered:
\par 
\par "It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall
\par sink lower, and be worse."
\par 
\par He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The
\par table trembled in the silence that followed.
\par 
\par She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to
\par be so, without looking at her, and said:
\par 
\par "Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of
\par what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?"
\par 
\par "If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
\par it would make me very glad!"
\par 
\par "God bless you for your sweet compassion!"
\par 
\par He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.
\par 
\par "Don't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say. I am like
\par one who died young. All my life might have been."
\par 
\par "No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am
\par sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself."
\par 
\par "Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the
\par mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget
\par it!"
\par 
\par She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair
\par of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
\par been holden.
\par 
\par "If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the
\par love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,
\par poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been
\par conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would
\par bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,
\par disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have
\par no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot
\par be."
\par 
\par "Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall
\par you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
\par confidence? I know this is a confidence," she modestly said, after a
\par little hesitation, and in earnest tears, "I know you would say this to
\par no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?"
\par 
\par He shook his head.
\par 
\par "To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very
\par little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that
\par you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not
\par been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this
\par home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
\par died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
\par I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
\par old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I
\par have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
\par sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all
\par a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,
\par but I wish you to know that you inspired it."
\par 
\par "Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!"
\par 
\par "No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
\par undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the
\par weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,
\par heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in
\par its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
\par service, idly burning away."
\par 
\par "Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy
\par than you were before you knew me--"
\par 
\par "Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
\par anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse."
\par 
\par "Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
\par attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can
\par make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
\par good, with you, at all?"
\par 
\par "The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come
\par here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,
\par the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;
\par and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
\par deplore and pity."
\par 
\par "Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with
\par all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!"
\par 
\par "Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,
\par and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let
\par me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life
\par was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
\par alone, and will be shared by no one?"
\par 
\par "If that will be a consolation to you, yes."
\par 
\par "Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?"
\par 
\par "Mr. Carton," she answered, after an agitated pause, "the secret is
\par yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it."
\par 
\par "Thank you. And again, God bless you."
\par 
\par He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.
\par 
\par "Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
\par conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it
\par again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In
\par the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and
\par shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
\par to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
\par in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!"
\par 
\par He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
\par sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept
\par down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he
\par stood looking back at her.
\par 
\par "Be comforted!" he said, "I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An
\par hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn
\par but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
\par wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I
\par shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be
\par what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make
\par to you, is, that you will believe this of me."
\par 
\par "I will, Mr. Carton."
\par 
\par "My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
\par you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
\par between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say
\par it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to
\par you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
\par there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
\par embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold
\par me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
\par thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
\par ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
\par and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
\par grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a
\par happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
\par beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
\par a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!"
\par 
\par He said, "Farewell!" said a last "God bless you!" and left her.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XIV. The Honest Tradesman
\par 
\par 
\par To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in
\par Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and
\par variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit
\par upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and
\par not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
\par westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,
\par both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
\par the sun goes down!
\par 
\par With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,
\par like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
\par watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
\par running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
\par since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
\par women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from
\par Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such
\par companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed
\par to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
\par have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from
\par the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
\par purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.
\par 
\par Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in
\par the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
\par but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.
\par 
\par It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
\par few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
\par unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
\par Cruncher must have been "flopping" in some pointed manner, when an
\par unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
\par attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
\par funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
\par funeral, which engendered uproar.
\par 
\par "Young Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, "it's a
\par buryin'."
\par 
\par "Hooroar, father!" cried Young Jerry.
\par 
\par The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
\par significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
\par his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.
\par 
\par "What d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey
\par to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for
\par _me_!" said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. "Him and his hooroars! Don't
\par let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D'ye
\par hear?"
\par 
\par "I warn't doing no harm," Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.
\par 
\par "Drop it then," said Mr. Cruncher; "I won't have none of _your_ no
\par harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd."
\par 
\par His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing
\par round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
\par there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were
\par considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position
\par appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble
\par surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and
\par incessantly groaning and calling out: "Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!"
\par with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.
\par 
\par Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he
\par always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed
\par Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance
\par excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:
\par 
\par "What is it, brother? What's it about?"
\par 
\par "_I_ don't know," said the man. "Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!"
\par 
\par He asked another man. "Who is it?"
\par 
\par "_I_ don't know," returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
\par nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
\par greatest ardour, "Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!"
\par 
\par At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled
\par against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
\par funeral of one Roger Cly.
\par 
\par "Was he a spy?" asked Mr. Cruncher.
\par 
\par "Old Bailey spy," returned his informant. "Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey
\par Spi--i--ies!"
\par 
\par "Why, to be sure!" exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had
\par assisted. "I've seen him. Dead, is he?"
\par 
\par "Dead as mutton," returned the other, "and can't be too dead. Have 'em
\par out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!"
\par 
\par The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,
\par that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
\par suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles
\par so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach
\par doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands
\par for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
\par that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
\par shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
\par other symbolical tears.
\par 
\par These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
\par enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a
\par crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.
\par They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
\par out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
\par its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being
\par much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
\par the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
\par while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
\par exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
\par was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from
\par the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning
\par coach.
\par 
\par The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
\par the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
\par remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
\par members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
\par The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the
\par hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under
\par close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended
\par by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a
\par popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional
\par ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his
\par bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to
\par that part of the procession in which he walked.
\par 
\par Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
\par caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
\par at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination
\par was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there
\par in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
\par accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and
\par highly to its own satisfaction.
\par 
\par The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of
\par providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter
\par genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
\par passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
\par was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
\par the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
\par they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of
\par window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
\par and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had
\par been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm
\par the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were
\par coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps
\par the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual
\par progress of a mob.
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
\par behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
\par The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a
\par neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and
\par maturely considering the spot.
\par 
\par "Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
\par "you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
\par was a young 'un and a straight made 'un."
\par 
\par Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
\par himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
\par station at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
\par his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all
\par amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
\par man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon
\par his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.
\par 
\par Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No
\par job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the
\par usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.
\par 
\par "Now, I tell you where it is!" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
\par entering. "If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I
\par shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you
\par for it just the same as if I seen you do it."
\par 
\par The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.
\par 
\par "Why, you're at it afore my face!" said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
\par angry apprehension.
\par 
\par "I am saying nothing."
\par 
\par "Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.
\par You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether."
\par 
\par "Yes, Jerry."
\par 
\par "Yes, Jerry," repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. "Ah! It _is_
\par yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry."
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,
\par but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general
\par ironical dissatisfaction.
\par 
\par "You and your yes, Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his
\par bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
\par oyster out of his saucer. "Ah! I think so. I believe you."
\par 
\par "You are going out to-night?" asked his decent wife, when he took
\par another bite.
\par 
\par "Yes, I am."
\par 
\par "May I go with you, father?" asked his son, briskly.
\par 
\par "No, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That's
\par where I'm going to. Going a fishing."
\par 
\par "Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?"
\par 
\par "Never you mind."
\par 
\par "Shall you bring any fish home, father?"
\par 
\par "If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow," returned that
\par gentleman, shaking his head; "that's questions enough for you; I ain't a
\par going out, till you've been long abed."
\par 
\par He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
\par most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
\par conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
\par to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in
\par conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
\par on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than
\par he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest
\par person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
\par honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a
\par professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.
\par 
\par "And mind you!" said Mr. Cruncher. "No games to-morrow! If I, as a
\par honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none
\par of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
\par tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
\par on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
\par customer to you, if you don't. _I_'m your Rome, you know."
\par 
\par Then he began grumbling again:
\par 
\par "With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don't
\par know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your
\par flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_
\par your'n, ain't he? He's as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,
\par and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?"
\par 
\par This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to
\par perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
\par all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
\par function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.
\par 
\par Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry
\par was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
\par obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
\par solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
\par o'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,
\par took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
\par forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
\par fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him
\par in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
\par extinguished the light, and went out.
\par 
\par Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
\par bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
\par followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
\par court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning
\par his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the
\par door stood ajar all night.
\par 
\par Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
\par father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
\par walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his
\par honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not
\par gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and
\par the two trudged on together.
\par 
\par Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
\par winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a
\par lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,
\par that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the
\par second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split
\par himself into two.
\par 
\par The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
\par under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low
\par brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and
\par wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which
\par the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
\par Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
\par Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
\par defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
\par He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
\par third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
\par there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
\par and knees.
\par 
\par It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did,
\par holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking
\par in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
\par and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard
\par that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church
\par tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not
\par creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to
\par fish.
\par 
\par They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
\par appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.
\par Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful
\par striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,
\par with his hair as stiff as his father's.
\par 
\par But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
\par only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They
\par were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
\par the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a
\par screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were
\par strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the
\par earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what
\par it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to
\par wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he
\par made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.
\par 
\par He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,
\par it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable
\par to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
\par was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt
\par upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him
\par and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to
\par shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
\par was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
\par roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
\par like a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
\par too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
\par to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,
\par and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was
\par incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy
\par got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then
\par it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
\par stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
\par his breast when he fell asleep.
\par 
\par From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after
\par daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
\par family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry
\par inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the
\par ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the
\par bed.
\par 
\par "I told you I would," said Mr. Cruncher, "and I did."
\par 
\par "Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!" his wife implored.
\par 
\par "You oppose yourself to the profit of the business," said Jerry, "and me
\par and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't
\par you?"
\par 
\par "I try to be a good wife, Jerry," the poor woman protested, with tears.
\par 
\par "Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it
\par honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
\par husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?"
\par 
\par "You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry."
\par 
\par "It's enough for you," retorted Mr. Cruncher, "to be the wife of a
\par honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
\par when he took to his trade or when he didn't. A honouring and obeying
\par wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious
\par woman? If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have
\par no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has
\par of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you."
\par 
\par The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in
\par the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down
\par at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on
\par his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay
\par down too, and fell asleep again.
\par 
\par There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
\par Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid
\par by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
\par he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed
\par and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
\par ostensible calling.
\par 
\par Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side
\par along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry
\par from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and
\par solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,
\par and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not
\par improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
\par that fine morning.
\par 
\par "Father," said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep
\par at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: "what's a
\par Resurrection-Man?"
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, "How
\par should I know?"
\par 
\par "I thought you knowed everything, father," said the artless boy.
\par 
\par "Hem! Well," returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his
\par hat to give his spikes free play, "he's a tradesman."
\par 
\par "What's his goods, father?" asked the brisk Young Jerry.
\par 
\par "His goods," said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, "is a
\par branch of Scientific goods."
\par 
\par "Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?" asked the lively boy.
\par 
\par "I believe it is something of that sort," said Mr. Cruncher.
\par 
\par "Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite
\par growed up!"
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.
\par "It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop
\par your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and
\par there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
\par for." As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,
\par to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to
\par himself: "Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will
\par yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XV. Knitting
\par 
\par 
\par There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
\par Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
\par through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
\par measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
\par of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
\par he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
\par influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No
\par vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
\par Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
\par the dregs of it.
\par 
\par This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been
\par early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
\par on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early
\par brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
\par slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
\par not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These
\par were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
\par have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
\par and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
\par looks.
\par 
\par Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop
\par was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
\par threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see
\par only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of
\par wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
\par and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
\par humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.
\par 
\par A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
\par observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
\par at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's
\par gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
\par towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
\par of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
\par with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
\par a long way off.
\par 
\par Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was
\par high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
\par his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a
\par mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered
\par the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
\par of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
\par flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had
\par followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
\par the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.
\par 
\par "Good day, gentlemen!" said Monsieur Defarge.
\par 
\par It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
\par an answering chorus of "Good day!"
\par 
\par "It is bad weather, gentlemen," said Defarge, shaking his head.
\par 
\par Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down
\par their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.
\par 
\par "My wife," said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: "I have
\par travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
\par Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris.
\par He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to
\par drink, my wife!"
\par 
\par A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the
\par mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,
\par and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
\par bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near
\par Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went out.
\par 
\par Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less
\par than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
\par rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
\par He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
\par Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.
\par 
\par "Have you finished your repast, friend?" he asked, in due season.
\par 
\par "Yes, thank you."
\par 
\par "Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
\par occupy. It will suit you to a marvel."
\par 
\par Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a
\par courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the
\par staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man
\par sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
\par 
\par No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had
\par gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired
\par man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at
\par him through the chinks in the wall.
\par 
\par Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:
\par 
\par "Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness
\par encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.
\par Speak, Jacques Five!"
\par 
\par The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with
\par it, and said, "Where shall I commence, monsieur?"
\par 
\par "Commence," was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, "at the
\par commencement."
\par 
\par "I saw him then, messieurs," began the mender of roads, "a year ago this
\par running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the
\par chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun
\par going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he
\par hanging by the chain--like this."
\par 
\par Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which
\par he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
\par the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
\par during a whole year.
\par 
\par Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?
\par 
\par "Never," answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.
\par 
\par Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?
\par 
\par "By his tall figure," said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
\par finger at his nose. "When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
\par 'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre.'"
\par 
\par "You should have said, short as a dwarf," returned Jacques Two.
\par 
\par "But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he
\par confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not
\par offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,
\par standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!'
\par My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing."
\par 
\par "He is right there, Jacques," murmured Defarge, to him who had
\par interrupted. "Go on!"
\par 
\par "Good!" said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. "The tall man
\par is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?"
\par 
\par "No matter, the number," said Defarge. "He is well hidden, but at last
\par he is unluckily found. Go on!"
\par 
\par "I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to
\par go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
\par village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see
\par coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man
\par with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!"
\par 
\par With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
\par elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.
\par 
\par "I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
\par and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any
\par spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I
\par see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and
\par that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun
\par going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that
\par their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
\par road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
\par Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
\par with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near
\par to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would
\par be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as
\par on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!"
\par 
\par He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
\par vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.
\par 
\par "I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not
\par show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with
\par our eyes. 'Come on!' says the chief of that company, pointing to the
\par village, 'bring him fast to his tomb!' and they bring him faster. I
\par follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden
\par shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and
\par consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!"
\par 
\par He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the
\par butt-ends of muskets.
\par 
\par "As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They
\par laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,
\par but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into
\par the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,
\par and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
\par darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!"
\par 
\par He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding
\par snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
\par opening it again, Defarge said, "Go on, Jacques."
\par 
\par "All the village," pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
\par voice, "withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
\par village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
\par locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,
\par except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
\par my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
\par my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty
\par iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no
\par hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
\par dead man."
\par 
\par Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all
\par of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
\par countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
\par authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One
\par and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on
\par his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally
\par intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding
\par over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge
\par standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the
\par light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to
\par him.
\par 
\par "Go on, Jacques," said Defarge.
\par 
\par "He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks
\par at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a
\par distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work
\par of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all
\par faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards
\par the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They
\par whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be
\par executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
\par that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say
\par that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?
\par It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no."
\par 
\par "Listen then, Jacques," Number One of that name sternly interposed.
\par "Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,
\par yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,
\par sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the
\par hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in
\par his hand."
\par 
\par "And once again listen, Jacques!" said the kneeling Number Three:
\par his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a
\par strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither
\par food nor drink; "the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,
\par and struck him blows. You hear?"
\par 
\par "I hear, messieurs."
\par 
\par "Go on then," said Defarge.
\par 
\par "Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain," resumed the
\par countryman, "that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
\par the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper
\par that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the
\par father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a
\par parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed
\par with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds
\par which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be
\par poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,
\par that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man
\par says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
\par the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?
\par I am not a scholar."
\par 
\par "Listen once again then, Jacques!" said the man with the restless hand
\par and the craving air. "The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was
\par all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and
\par nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than
\par the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager
\par attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
\par when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
\par done--why, how old are you?"
\par 
\par "Thirty-five," said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.
\par 
\par "It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen
\par it."
\par 
\par "Enough!" said Defarge, with grim impatience. "Long live the Devil! Go
\par on."
\par 
\par "Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
\par even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
\par night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
\par the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.
\par Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by
\par the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the
\par water."
\par 
\par The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,
\par and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.
\par 
\par "All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
\par the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers
\par have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst
\par of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is
\par a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he
\par laughed." He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,
\par from the corners of his mouth to his ears. "On the top of the gallows is
\par fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged
\par there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water."
\par 
\par They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,
\par on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
\par spectacle.
\par 
\par "It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw
\par water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have
\par I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to
\par bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,
\par across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,
\par messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!"
\par 
\par The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
\par three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.
\par 
\par "That's all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
\par and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
\par warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now
\par walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here
\par you see me!"
\par 
\par After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, "Good! You have acted
\par and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the
\par door?"
\par 
\par "Very willingly," said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the
\par top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.
\par 
\par The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to
\par the garret.
\par 
\par "How say you, Jacques?" demanded Number One. "To be registered?"
\par 
\par "To be registered, as doomed to destruction," returned Defarge.
\par 
\par "Magnificent!" croaked the man with the craving.
\par 
\par "The chateau, and all the race?" inquired the first.
\par 
\par "The chateau and all the race," returned Defarge. "Extermination."
\par 
\par The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, "Magnificent!" and began
\par gnawing another finger.
\par 
\par "Are you sure," asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, "that no embarrassment
\par can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is
\par safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
\par be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?"
\par 
\par "Jacques," returned Defarge, drawing himself up, "if madame my wife
\par undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose
\par a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her
\par own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in
\par Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
\par to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
\par crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge."
\par 
\par There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
\par hungered, asked: "Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is
\par very simple; is he not a little dangerous?"
\par 
\par "He knows nothing," said Defarge; "at least nothing more than would
\par easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself
\par with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him
\par on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and
\par Court; let him see them on Sunday."
\par 
\par "What?" exclaimed the hungry man, staring. "Is it a good sign, that he
\par wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?"
\par 
\par "Jacques," said Defarge; "judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her
\par to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
\par him to bring it down one day."
\par 
\par Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already
\par dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the
\par pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon
\par asleep.
\par 
\par Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found
\par in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious
\par dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very
\par new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly
\par unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that
\par his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that
\par he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he
\par contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
\par might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it
\par into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
\par murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through
\par with it until the play was played out.
\par 
\par Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted
\par (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
\par and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have
\par madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
\par additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the
\par afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
\par see the carriage of the King and Queen.
\par 
\par "You work hard, madame," said a man near her.
\par 
\par "Yes," answered Madame Defarge; "I have a good deal to do."
\par 
\par "What do you make, madame?"
\par 
\par "Many things."
\par 
\par "For instance--"
\par 
\par "For instance," returned Madame Defarge, composedly, "shrouds."
\par 
\par The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender
\par of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close
\par and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was
\par fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King
\par and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the
\par shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
\par ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
\par and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
\par sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary
\par intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,
\par Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of
\par ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,
\par terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,
\par more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept
\par with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three
\par hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,
\par and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him
\par from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
\par pieces.
\par 
\par "Bravo!" said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a
\par patron; "you are a good boy!"
\par 
\par The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of
\par having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.
\par 
\par "You are the fellow we want," said Defarge, in his ear; "you make
\par these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more
\par insolent, and it is the nearer ended."
\par 
\par "Hey!" cried the mender of roads, reflectively; "that's true."
\par 
\par "These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would
\par stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than
\par in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath
\par tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
\par deceive them too much."
\par 
\par Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
\par confirmation.
\par 
\par "As to you," said she, "you would shout and shed tears for anything, if
\par it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?"
\par 
\par "Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment."
\par 
\par "If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to
\par pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would
\par pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?"
\par 
\par "Truly yes, madame."
\par 
\par "Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
\par set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
\par you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?"
\par 
\par "It is true, madame."
\par 
\par "You have seen both dolls and birds to-day," said Madame Defarge, with
\par a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;
\par "now, go home!"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XVI. Still Knitting
\par 
\par 
\par Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
\par bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
\par darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
\par the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
\par the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to
\par the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,
\par for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village
\par scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
\par stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
\par terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
\par the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the
\par village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that
\par when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to
\par faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled
\par up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel
\par look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the
\par stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder
\par was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which
\par everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the
\par scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
\par crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a
\par skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all
\par started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares
\par who could find a living there.
\par 
\par Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
\par stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres
\par of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the
\par night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole
\par world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling
\par star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
\par the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in
\par the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every
\par vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.
\par 
\par The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
\par in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their
\par journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier
\par guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
\par examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two
\par of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate
\par with, and affectionately embraced.
\par 
\par When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,
\par and they, having finally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were
\par picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
\par streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:
\par 
\par "Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?"
\par 
\par "Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy
\par commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he
\par can say, but he knows of one."
\par 
\par "Eh well!" said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
\par business air. "It is necessary to register him. How do they call that
\par man?"
\par 
\par "He is English."
\par 
\par "So much the better. His name?"
\par 
\par "Barsad," said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had
\par been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect
\par correctness.
\par 
\par "Barsad," repeated madame. "Good. Christian name?"
\par 
\par "John."
\par 
\par "John Barsad," repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.
\par "Good. His appearance; is it known?"
\par 
\par "Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;
\par complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face
\par thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a
\par peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,
\par sinister."
\par 
\par "Eh my faith. It is a portrait!" said madame, laughing. "He shall be
\par registered to-morrow."
\par 
\par They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),
\par and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted
\par the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the
\par stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of
\par her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally
\par dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl
\par of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
\par handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
\par night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked
\par up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which
\par condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he
\par walked up and down through life.
\par 
\par The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a
\par neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was
\par by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
\par it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He
\par whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.
\par 
\par "You are fatigued," said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the
\par money. "There are only the usual odours."
\par 
\par "I am a little tired," her husband acknowledged.
\par 
\par "You are a little depressed, too," said madame, whose quick eyes had
\par never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for
\par him. "Oh, the men, the men!"
\par 
\par "But my dear!" began Defarge.
\par 
\par "But my dear!" repeated madame, nodding firmly; "but my dear! You are
\par faint of heart to-night, my dear!"
\par 
\par "Well, then," said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his
\par breast, "it _is_ a long time."
\par 
\par "It is a long time," repeated his wife; "and when is it not a long time?
\par Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule."
\par 
\par "It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning," said
\par Defarge.
\par 
\par "How long," demanded madame, composedly, "does it take to make and store
\par the lightning? Tell me."
\par 
\par Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that
\par too.
\par 
\par "It does not take a long time," said madame, "for an earthquake to
\par swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
\par earthquake?"
\par 
\par "A long time, I suppose," said Defarge.
\par 
\par "But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
\par before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not
\par seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it."
\par 
\par She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.
\par 
\par "I tell thee," said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,
\par "that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and
\par coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it
\par is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world
\par that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider
\par the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with
\par more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock
\par you."
\par 
\par "My brave wife," returned Defarge, standing before her with his head
\par a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and
\par attentive pupil before his catechist, "I do not question all this. But
\par it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,
\par it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives."
\par 
\par "Eh well! How then?" demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there
\par were another enemy strangled.
\par 
\par "Well!" said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.
\par "We shall not see the triumph."
\par 
\par "We shall have helped it," returned madame, with her extended hand in
\par strong action. "Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all
\par my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew
\par certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I
\par would--"
\par 
\par Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.
\par 
\par "Hold!" cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with
\par cowardice; "I too, my dear, will stop at nothing."
\par 
\par "Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
\par and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.
\par When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the
\par time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready."
\par 
\par Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
\par little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
\par out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene
\par manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.
\par 
\par Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
\par wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she
\par now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her
\par usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not
\par drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,
\par and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
\par perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
\par dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies
\par out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
\par themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
\par the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they
\par thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.
\par 
\par A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she
\par felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her
\par rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.
\par 
\par It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
\par customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the
\par wine-shop.
\par 
\par "Good day, madame," said the new-comer.
\par 
\par "Good day, monsieur."
\par 
\par She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
\par "Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black
\par hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,
\par thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a
\par peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
\par expression! Good day, one and all!"
\par 
\par "Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a
\par mouthful of cool fresh water, madame."
\par 
\par Madame complied with a polite air.
\par 
\par "Marvellous cognac this, madame!"
\par 
\par It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame
\par Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,
\par however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The
\par visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity
\par of observing the place in general.
\par 
\par "You knit with great skill, madame."
\par 
\par "I am accustomed to it."
\par 
\par "A pretty pattern too!"
\par 
\par "_You_ think so?" said madame, looking at him with a smile.
\par 
\par "Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?"
\par 
\par "Pastime," said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
\par fingers moved nimbly.
\par 
\par "Not for use?"
\par 
\par "That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well," said
\par madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
\par coquetry, "I'll use it!"
\par 
\par It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be
\par decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two
\par men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
\par catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of
\par looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
\par Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there
\par one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,
\par but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a
\par poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and
\par unimpeachable.
\par 
\par "_John_," thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,
\par and her eyes looked at the stranger. "Stay long enough, and I shall knit
\par 'BARSAD' before you go."
\par 
\par "You have a husband, madame?"
\par 
\par "I have."
\par 
\par "Children?"
\par 
\par "No children."
\par 
\par "Business seems bad?"
\par 
\par "Business is very bad; the people are so poor."
\par 
\par "Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say."
\par 
\par "As _you_ say," madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an
\par extra something into his name that boded him no good.
\par 
\par "Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.
\par Of course."
\par 
\par "_I_ think?" returned madame, in a high voice. "I and my husband have
\par enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we
\par think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and
\par it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without
\par embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no."
\par 
\par The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did
\par not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,
\par stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame
\par Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.
\par 
\par "A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the poor
\par Gaspard!" With a sigh of great compassion.
\par 
\par "My faith!" returned madame, coolly and lightly, "if people use knives
\par for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the
\par price of his luxury was; he has paid the price."
\par 
\par "I believe," said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone
\par that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary
\par susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: "I believe there
\par is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor
\par fellow? Between ourselves."
\par 
\par "Is there?" asked madame, vacantly.
\par 
\par "Is there not?"
\par 
\par "--Here is my husband!" said Madame Defarge.
\par 
\par As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
\par him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, "Good day,
\par Jacques!" Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.
\par 
\par "Good day, Jacques!" the spy repeated; with not quite so much
\par confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.
\par 
\par "You deceive yourself, monsieur," returned the keeper of the wine-shop.
\par "You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge."
\par 
\par "It is all the same," said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: "good
\par day!"
\par 
\par "Good day!" answered Defarge, drily.
\par 
\par "I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when
\par you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy
\par and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard."
\par 
\par "No one has told me so," said Defarge, shaking his head. "I know nothing
\par of it."
\par 
\par Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his
\par hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the
\par person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would
\par have shot with the greatest satisfaction.
\par 
\par The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
\par attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh
\par water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it
\par out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over
\par it.
\par 
\par "You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?"
\par observed Defarge.
\par 
\par "Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested
\par in its miserable inhabitants."
\par 
\par "Hah!" muttered Defarge.
\par 
\par "The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,"
\par pursued the spy, "that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting
\par associations with your name."
\par 
\par "Indeed!" said Defarge, with much indifference.
\par 
\par "Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,
\par had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am
\par informed of the circumstances?"
\par 
\par "Such is the fact, certainly," said Defarge. He had had it conveyed
\par to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and
\par warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.
\par 
\par "It was to you," said the spy, "that his daughter came; and it was
\par from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown
\par monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of
\par Tellson and Company--over to England."
\par 
\par "Such is the fact," repeated Defarge.
\par 
\par "Very interesting remembrances!" said the spy. "I have known Doctor
\par Manette and his daughter, in England."
\par 
\par "Yes?" said Defarge.
\par 
\par "You don't hear much about them now?" said the spy.
\par 
\par "No," said Defarge.
\par 
\par "In effect," madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little
\par song, "we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe
\par arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
\par they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held
\par no correspondence."
\par 
\par "Perfectly so, madame," replied the spy. "She is going to be married."
\par 
\par "Going?" echoed madame. "She was pretty enough to have been married long
\par ago. You English are cold, it seems to me."
\par 
\par "Oh! You know I am English."
\par 
\par "I perceive your tongue is," returned madame; "and what the tongue is, I
\par suppose the man is."
\par 
\par He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best
\par of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the
\par end, he added:
\par 
\par "Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to
\par one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,
\par poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is
\par going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard
\par was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present
\par Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is
\par Mr. Charles Darnay. D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family."
\par 
\par Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
\par effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,
\par as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was
\par troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no
\par spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.
\par 
\par Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
\par worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad
\par paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,
\par in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the
\par pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes
\par after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the
\par husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should
\par come back.
\par 
\par "Can it be true," said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife
\par as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: "what he has
\par said of Ma'amselle Manette?"
\par 
\par "As he has said it," returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, "it
\par is probably false. But it may be true."
\par 
\par "If it is--" Defarge began, and stopped.
\par 
\par "If it is?" repeated his wife.
\par 
\par "--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her
\par sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France."
\par 
\par "Her husband's destiny," said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,
\par "will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is
\par to end him. That is all I know."
\par 
\par "But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange"--said
\par Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,
\par "that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her
\par husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
\par the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?"
\par 
\par "Stranger things than that will happen when it does come," answered
\par madame. "I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here
\par for their merits; that is enough."
\par 
\par She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently
\par took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.
\par Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
\par decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its
\par disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very
\par shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.
\par 
\par In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
\par himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
\par to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame
\par Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
\par to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like
\par her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women
\par knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a
\par mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
\par jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,
\par the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.
\par 
\par But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame
\par Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer
\par among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left
\par behind.
\par 
\par Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. "A
\par great woman," said he, "a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully
\par grand woman!"
\par 
\par Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and
\par the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as
\par the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another
\par darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing
\par pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into
\par thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a
\par wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty,
\par Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat
\par knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around
\par a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
\par counting dropping heads.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XVII. One Night
\par 
\par 
\par Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
\par Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat
\par under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder
\par radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
\par seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.
\par 
\par Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening
\par for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.
\par 
\par "You are happy, my dear father?"
\par 
\par "Quite, my child."
\par 
\par They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it
\par was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself
\par in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in
\par both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this
\par time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.
\par 
\par "And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the
\par love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love
\par for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
\par if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by
\par the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and
\par self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--"
\par 
\par Even as it was, she could not command her voice.
\par 
\par In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face
\par upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of
\par the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and
\par its going.
\par 
\par "Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
\par quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
\par ever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your
\par own heart, do you feel quite certain?"
\par 
\par Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
\par scarcely have assumed, "Quite sure, my darling! More than that," he
\par added, as he tenderly kissed her: "my future is far brighter, Lucie,
\par seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever
\par was--without it."
\par 
\par "If I could hope _that_, my father!--"
\par 
\par "Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain
\par it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot
\par fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
\par wasted--"
\par 
\par She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated
\par the word.
\par 
\par "--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the
\par natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely
\par comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,
\par how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?"
\par 
\par "If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy
\par with you."
\par 
\par He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
\par without Charles, having seen him; and replied:
\par 
\par "My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been
\par Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I
\par should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have
\par cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you."
\par 
\par It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him
\par refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new
\par sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long
\par afterwards.
\par 
\par "See!" said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.
\par "I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her
\par light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
\par of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against
\par my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,
\par that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I
\par could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines
\par with which I could intersect them." He added in his inward and pondering
\par manner, as he looked at the moon, "It was twenty either way, I remember,
\par and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in."
\par 
\par The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,
\par deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in
\par the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present
\par cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.
\par 
\par "I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
\par child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had
\par been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it
\par was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my
\par imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it
\par was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live
\par to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own
\par will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman."
\par 
\par She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.
\par 
\par "I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
\par me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have
\par cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married
\par to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from
\par the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a
\par blank."
\par 
\par "My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
\par never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child."
\par 
\par "You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
\par brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
\par the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?"
\par 
\par "She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you."
\par 
\par "So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence
\par have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as
\par like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its
\par foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and
\par leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her
\par image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held
\par her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.
\par But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?"
\par 
\par "The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?"
\par 
\par "No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of
\par sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another
\par and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than
\par that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you
\par have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?
\par I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
\par perplexed distinctions."
\par 
\par His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
\par cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.
\par 
\par "In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,
\par coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
\par life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture
\par was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,
\par cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all."
\par 
\par "I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
\par that was I."
\par 
\par "And she showed me her children," said the Doctor of Beauvais, "and
\par they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed
\par a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked
\par up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I
\par imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.
\par But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and
\par blessed her."
\par 
\par "I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless
\par me as fervently to-morrow?"
\par 
\par "Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night
\par for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great
\par happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the
\par happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us."
\par 
\par He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked
\par Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the
\par house.
\par 
\par There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to
\par be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no
\par change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
\par by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
\par apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.
\par 
\par Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only
\par three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles
\par was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving
\par little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.
\par 
\par So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.
\par But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came
\par downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
\par beforehand.
\par 
\par All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay
\par asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his
\par hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the
\par shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;
\par then, leaned over him, and looked at him.
\par 
\par Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he
\par covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the
\par mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,
\par resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be
\par beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.
\par 
\par She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that
\par she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his
\par sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once
\par more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves
\par of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved
\par in praying for him.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XVIII. Nine Days
\par 
\par 
\par The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
\par closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles
\par Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.
\par Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of
\par reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,
\par but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should
\par have been the bridegroom.
\par 
\par "And so," said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,
\par and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,
\par pretty dress; "and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought
\par you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought
\par what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring
\par on my friend Mr. Charles!"
\par 
\par "You didn't mean it," remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, "and
\par therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!"
\par 
\par "Really? Well; but don't cry," said the gentle Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "I am not crying," said Miss Pross; "_you_ are."
\par 
\par "I, my Pross?" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,
\par on occasion.)
\par 
\par "You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such
\par a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into
\par anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection," said
\par Miss Pross, "that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till
\par I couldn't see it."
\par 
\par "I am highly gratified," said Mr. Lorry, "though, upon my honour, I
\par had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
\par invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man
\par speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there
\par might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!"
\par 
\par "Not at all!" From Miss Pross.
\par 
\par "You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?" asked the
\par gentleman of that name.
\par 
\par "Pooh!" rejoined Miss Pross; "you were a bachelor in your cradle."
\par 
\par "Well!" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, "that
\par seems probable, too."
\par 
\par "And you were cut out for a bachelor," pursued Miss Pross, "before you
\par were put in your cradle."
\par 
\par "Then, I think," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was very unhandsomely dealt
\par with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
\par pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie," drawing his arm soothingly round
\par her waist, "I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and
\par I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final
\par opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave
\par your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your
\par own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
\par fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's
\par shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at
\par the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on
\par your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
\par him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear
\par Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an
\par old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his
\par own."
\par 
\par For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the
\par well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright
\par golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and
\par delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.
\par 
\par The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles
\par Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they
\par went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.
\par But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the
\par shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
\par old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold
\par wind.
\par 
\par He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot
\par which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in
\par another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange
\par eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.
\par 
\par Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
\par group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
\par glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the
\par dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to
\par breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had
\par mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were
\par mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the
\par door at parting.
\par 
\par It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father
\par cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her
\par enfolding arms, "Take her, Charles! She is yours!"
\par 
\par And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was
\par gone.
\par 
\par The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
\par preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
\par and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into
\par the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great
\par change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted
\par there, had struck him a poisoned blow.
\par 
\par He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been
\par expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was
\par the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent
\par manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
\par room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the
\par wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.
\par 
\par "I think," he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, "I
\par think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.
\par I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back
\par presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine
\par there, and all will be well."
\par 
\par It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of
\par Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the
\par old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus
\par into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.
\par 
\par "Good God!" he said, with a start. "What's that?"
\par 
\par Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. "O me, O me! All is
\par lost!" cried she, wringing her hands. "What is to be told to Ladybird?
\par He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
\par Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
\par when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent
\par down, and he was very busy.
\par 
\par "Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!"
\par 
\par The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he
\par were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.
\par 
\par He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the
\par throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old
\par haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked
\par hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a
\par shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by
\par him, and asked what it was.
\par 
\par "A young lady's walking shoe," he muttered, without looking up. "It
\par ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be."
\par 
\par "But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!"
\par 
\par He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in
\par his work.
\par 
\par "You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper
\par occupation. Think, dear friend!"
\par 
\par Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at
\par a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract
\par a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and
\par words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on
\par the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that
\par he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there
\par seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were
\par trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.
\par 
\par Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above
\par all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;
\par the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In
\par conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter
\par precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a
\par few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised
\par on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been
\par called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
\par two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
\par addressed to her by the same post.
\par 
\par These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
\par the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept
\par another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he
\par thought the best, on the Doctor's case.
\par 
\par In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course
\par being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him
\par attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He
\par therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the
\par first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same
\par room.
\par 
\par He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
\par to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that
\par attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always
\par before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
\par fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the
\par window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
\par natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.
\par 
\par Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,
\par that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour
\par after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.
\par When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose
\par and said to him:
\par 
\par "Will you go out?"
\par 
\par He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,
\par looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:
\par 
\par "Out?"
\par 
\par "Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"
\par 
\par He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.
\par Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,
\par with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in
\par some misty way asking himself, "Why not?" The sagacity of the man of
\par business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.
\par 
\par Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him
\par at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long
\par time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he
\par fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his
\par bench and to work.
\par 
\par On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
\par and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He
\par returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and
\par that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry
\par to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;
\par at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then
\par present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
\par amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
\par enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's
\par friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
\par appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
\par him.
\par 
\par When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:
\par 
\par "Dear Doctor, will you go out?"
\par 
\par As before, he repeated, "Out?"
\par 
\par "Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"
\par 
\par This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
\par from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the
\par meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had
\par sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he
\par slipped away to his bench.
\par 
\par The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his
\par heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
\par The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,
\par seven days, eight days, nine days.
\par 
\par With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and
\par heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was
\par well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to
\par observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,
\par was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on
\par his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in
\par the dusk of the ninth evening.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XIX. An Opinion
\par 
\par 
\par Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the
\par tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun
\par into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
\par night.
\par 
\par He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had
\par done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the
\par Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench
\par and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading
\par at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which
\par Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly
\par studious and attentive.
\par 
\par Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
\par giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
\par not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his
\par friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed
\par as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of
\par which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?
\par 
\par It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
\par answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real
\par corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?
\par How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor
\par Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
\par Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?
\par 
\par Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he
\par had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
\par resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
\par He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
\par breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual
\par had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.
\par Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
\par the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.
\par 
\par Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked
\par out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical
\par toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual
\par white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the
\par usual way, and came to breakfast.
\par 
\par So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
\par delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe
\par advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken
\par place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to
\par the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
\par counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,
\par he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid
\par he sought. And that aid was his own.
\par 
\par Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the
\par Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:
\par 
\par "My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a
\par very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is
\par very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less
\par so."
\par 
\par Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the
\par Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced
\par at his hands more than once.
\par 
\par "Doctor Manette," said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the
\par arm, "the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray
\par give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,
\par for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette."
\par 
\par "If I understand," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, "some mental
\par shock--?"
\par 
\par "Yes!"
\par 
\par "Be explicit," said the Doctor. "Spare no detail."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.
\par 
\par "My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,
\par of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,
\par the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a
\par shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how
\par long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there
\par are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from
\par which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace
\par himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is
\par the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to
\par be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and
\par great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his
\par stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,
\par there has been," he paused and took a deep breath--"a slight relapse."
\par 
\par The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, "Of how long duration?"
\par 
\par "Nine days and nights."
\par 
\par "How did it show itself? I infer," glancing at his hands again, "in the
\par resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?"
\par 
\par "That is the fact."
\par 
\par "Now, did you ever see him," asked the Doctor, distinctly and
\par collectedly, though in the same low voice, "engaged in that pursuit
\par originally?"
\par 
\par "Once."
\par 
\par "And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all
\par respects--as he was then?"
\par 
\par "I think in all respects."
\par 
\par "You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?"
\par 
\par "No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.
\par It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted."
\par 
\par The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, "That was very kind. That was
\par very thoughtful!" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of
\par the two spoke for a little while.
\par 
\par "Now, my dear Manette," said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most
\par considerate and most affectionate way, "I am a mere man of business,
\par and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not
\par possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
\par intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom
\par I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this
\par relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it
\par be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come
\par about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been
\par more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,
\par if I knew how.
\par 
\par "But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,
\par knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be
\par able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
\par Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
\par and teach me how to be a little more useful."
\par 
\par Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and
\par Mr. Lorry did not press him.
\par 
\par "I think it probable," said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,
\par "that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
\par unforeseen by its subject."
\par 
\par "Was it dreaded by him?" Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.
\par 
\par "Very much." He said it with an involuntary shudder.
\par 
\par "You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's
\par mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force
\par himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him."
\par 
\par "Would he," asked Mr. Lorry, "be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
\par upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on
\par him?"
\par 
\par "I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even
\par believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible."
\par 
\par "Now," said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm again,
\par after a short silence on both sides, "to what would you refer this
\par attack?"
\par 
\par "I believe," returned Doctor Manette, "that there had been a strong and
\par extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
\par was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most
\par distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that
\par there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations
\par would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a
\par particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the
\par effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it."
\par 
\par "Would he remember what took place in the relapse?" asked Mr. Lorry,
\par with natural hesitation.
\par 
\par The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and
\par answered, in a low voice, "Not at all."
\par 
\par "Now, as to the future," hinted Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "As to the future," said the Doctor, recovering firmness, "I should have
\par great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I
\par should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated
\par something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,
\par and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that
\par the worst was over."
\par 
\par "Well, well! That's good comfort. I am thankful!" said Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "I am thankful!" repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.
\par 
\par "There are two other points," said Mr. Lorry, "on which I am anxious to
\par be instructed. I may go on?"
\par 
\par "You cannot do your friend a better service." The Doctor gave him his
\par hand.
\par 
\par "To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
\par he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
\par knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does
\par he do too much?"
\par 
\par "I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in
\par singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in
\par part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy
\par things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
\par direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery."
\par 
\par "You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?"
\par 
\par "I think I am quite sure of it."
\par 
\par "My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--"
\par 
\par "My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a
\par violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight."
\par 
\par "Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,
\par that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this
\par disorder?"
\par 
\par "I do not think so. I do not think," said Doctor Manette with the
\par firmness of self-conviction, "that anything but the one train of
\par association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some
\par extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has
\par happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any
\par such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost
\par believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted."
\par 
\par He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
\par would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
\par confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
\par endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that
\par confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
\par really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to
\par be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning
\par conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the
\par last nine days, he knew that he must face it.
\par 
\par "The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
\par so happily recovered from," said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, "we
\par will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put a
\par case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
\par time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly
\par found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by
\par him?"
\par 
\par The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot
\par nervously on the ground.
\par 
\par "He has always kept it by him," said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at
\par his friend. "Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?"
\par 
\par Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the
\par ground.
\par 
\par "You do not find it easy to advise me?" said Mr. Lorry. "I quite
\par understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--" And there he
\par shook his head, and stopped.
\par 
\par "You see," said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,
\par "it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
\par of this poor man's mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that
\par occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved
\par his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
\par the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more
\par practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental
\par torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
\par quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of
\par himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind
\par of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not
\par find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may
\par fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child."
\par 
\par He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's
\par face.
\par 
\par "But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business
\par who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and
\par bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
\par the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go
\par with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the
\par forge?"
\par 
\par There was another silence.
\par 
\par "You see, too," said the Doctor, tremulously, "it is such an old
\par companion."
\par 
\par "I would not keep it," said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained
\par in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. "I would recommend him to
\par sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.
\par Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter's
\par sake, my dear Manette!"
\par 
\par Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!
\par 
\par "In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take
\par it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;
\par let him miss his old companion after an absence."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They
\par passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the
\par three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth
\par day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that
\par had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
\par explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
\par she had no suspicions.
\par 
\par On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into
\par his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross
\par carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
\par guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while
\par Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for
\par which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The
\par burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
\par purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
\par shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction
\par and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,
\par while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
\par traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible
\par crime.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XX. A Plea
\par 
\par 
\par When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
\par offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home
\par many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or
\par in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
\par about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.
\par 
\par He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of
\par speaking to him when no one overheard.
\par 
\par "Mr. Darnay," said Carton, "I wish we might be friends."
\par 
\par "We are already friends, I hope."
\par 
\par "You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't
\par mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
\par friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either."
\par 
\par Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and
\par good-fellowship, what he did mean?
\par 
\par "Upon my life," said Carton, smiling, "I find that easier to comprehend
\par in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You
\par remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than
\par usual?"
\par 
\par "I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
\par you had been drinking."
\par 
\par "I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I
\par always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day,
\par when all days are at an end for me! Don't be alarmed; I am not going to
\par preach."
\par 
\par "I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming
\par to me."
\par 
\par "Ah!" said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that
\par away. "On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as
\par you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I
\par wish you would forget it."
\par 
\par "I forgot it long ago."
\par 
\par "Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to
\par me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,
\par and a light answer does not help me to forget it."
\par 
\par "If it was a light answer," returned Darnay, "I beg your forgiveness
\par for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
\par surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the
\par faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good
\par Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to
\par remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?"
\par 
\par "As to the great service," said Carton, "I am bound to avow to you, when
\par you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I
\par don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I
\par say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past."
\par 
\par "You make light of the obligation," returned Darnay, "but I will not
\par quarrel with _your_ light answer."
\par 
\par "Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose;
\par I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am
\par incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it,
\par ask Stryver, and he'll tell you so."
\par 
\par "I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his."
\par 
\par "Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done
\par any good, and never will."
\par 
\par "I don't know that you 'never will.'"
\par 
\par "But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure
\par to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent
\par reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be
\par permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
\par be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the
\par resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of
\par furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I
\par doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I
\par should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I
\par dare say, to know that I had it."
\par 
\par "Will you try?"
\par 
\par "That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have
\par indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?"
\par 
\par "I think so, Carton, by this time."
\par 
\par They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute
\par afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.
\par 
\par When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss
\par Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of
\par this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a
\par problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not
\par bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw
\par him as he showed himself.
\par 
\par He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
\par wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
\par her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
\par marked.
\par 
\par "We are thoughtful to-night!" said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.
\par 
\par "Yes, dearest Charles," with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring
\par and attentive expression fixed upon him; "we are rather thoughtful
\par to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night."
\par 
\par "What is it, my Lucie?"
\par 
\par "Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to
\par ask it?"
\par 
\par "Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?"
\par 
\par What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
\par cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!
\par 
\par "I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
\par respect than you expressed for him to-night."
\par 
\par "Indeed, my own? Why so?"
\par 
\par "That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does."
\par 
\par "If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?"
\par 
\par "I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very
\par lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that
\par he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
\par wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding."
\par 
\par "It is a painful reflection to me," said Charles Darnay, quite
\par astounded, "that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this
\par of him."
\par 
\par "My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
\par scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
\par now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,
\par even magnanimous things."
\par 
\par She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,
\par that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.
\par 
\par "And, O my dearest Love!" she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her
\par head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, "remember how strong
\par we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!"
\par 
\par The supplication touched him home. "I will always remember it, dear
\par Heart! I will remember it as long as I live."
\par 
\par He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded
\par her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,
\par could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops
\par of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
\par that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not
\par have parted from his lips for the first time--
\par 
\par "God bless her for her sweet compassion!"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XXI. Echoing Footsteps
\par 
\par 
\par A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
\par the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
\par her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and
\par companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in
\par the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of
\par years.
\par 
\par At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,
\par when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be
\par dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,
\par afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.
\par Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:
\par doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided
\par her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of
\par footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would
\par be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her
\par eyes, and broke like waves.
\par 
\par That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the
\par advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
\par her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young
\par mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and
\par the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of
\par children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take
\par her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred
\par joy to her.
\par 
\par Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
\par weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
\par their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the
\par echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband's
\par step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and equal.
\par Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
\par unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the
\par plane-tree in the garden!
\par 
\par Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not
\par harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a
\par pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant
\par smile, "Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to
\par leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!" those were not
\par tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek, as the spirit
\par departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and
\par forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words!
\par 
\par Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other
\par echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
\par of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were
\par mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed
\par murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as
\par the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or
\par dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of
\par the Two Cities that were blended in her life.
\par 
\par The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some
\par half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
\par uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once
\par done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing
\par regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
\par all true echoes for ages and ages.
\par 
\par No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a
\par blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,
\par but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive
\par delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
\par such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton
\par was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,
\par and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of
\par him, almost at the last. "Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!"
\par 
\par Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine
\par forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in
\par his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually
\par in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
\par life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
\par stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
\par it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
\par state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
\par rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
\par property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them
\par but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
\par 
\par These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most
\par offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three
\par sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
\par Lucie's husband: delicately saying "Halloa! here are three lumps of
\par bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!" The polite
\par rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.
\par Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the
\par training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the
\par pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of
\par declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts
\par Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to "catch" him, and on the
\par diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him "not
\par to be caught." Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally
\par parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the
\par latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed
\par it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
\par originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried
\par off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.
\par 
\par These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes
\par amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little
\par daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her
\par child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always active
\par and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not be told.
\par Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself
\par with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
\par waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet
\par in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her
\par more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the
\par many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
\par to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her "What is
\par the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,
\par as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to
\par have too much to do?"
\par 
\par But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly
\par in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about
\par little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,
\par as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.
\par 
\par On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.
\par Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and
\par her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were
\par all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the
\par lightning from the same place.
\par 
\par "I began to think," said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, "that
\par I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of
\par business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way
\par to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a
\par run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able
\par to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania
\par among some of them for sending it to England."
\par 
\par "That has a bad look," said Darnay--
\par 
\par "A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason
\par there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are
\par getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course
\par without due occasion."
\par 
\par "Still," said Darnay, "you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is."
\par 
\par "I know that, to be sure," assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
\par himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, "but I
\par am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration. Where is
\par Manette?"
\par 
\par "Here he is," said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.
\par 
\par "I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by
\par which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without
\par reason. You are not going out, I hope?"
\par 
\par "No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like," said the
\par Doctor.
\par 
\par "I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be
\par pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can't
\par see."
\par 
\par "Of course, it has been kept for you."
\par 
\par "Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?"
\par 
\par "And sleeping soundly."
\par 
\par "That's right; all safe and well! I don't know why anything should be
\par otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out
\par all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,
\par come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear
\par the echoes about which you have your theory."
\par 
\par "Not a theory; it was a fancy."
\par 
\par "A fancy, then, my wise pet," said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. "They
\par are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!"
\par 
\par Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's
\par life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the
\par footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in
\par the dark London window.
\par 
\par Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
\par heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
\par heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous
\par roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms
\par struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:
\par all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
\par weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.
\par 
\par Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what
\par agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the
\par heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could
\par have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,
\par powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every
\par weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who
\par could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to
\par force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and
\par heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
\par Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
\par with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.
\par 
\par As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging
\par circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron
\par had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,
\par already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
\par thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
\par another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.
\par 
\par "Keep near to me, Jacques Three," cried Defarge; "and do you, Jacques
\par One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
\par patriots as you can. Where is my wife?"
\par 
\par "Eh, well! Here you see me!" said madame, composed as ever, but not
\par knitting to-day. Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,
\par in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol
\par and a cruel knife.
\par 
\par "Where do you go, my wife?"
\par 
\par "I go," said madame, "with you at present. You shall see me at the head
\par of women, by-and-bye."
\par 
\par "Come, then!" cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. "Patriots and
\par friends, we are ready! The Bastille!"
\par 
\par With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped
\par into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on
\par depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums
\par beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack
\par began.
\par 
\par Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
\par towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through
\par the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against
\par a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the
\par wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.
\par 
\par Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,
\par cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! "Work, comrades
\par all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques
\par Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all
\par the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!" Thus Defarge of the
\par wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.
\par 
\par "To me, women!" cried madame his wife. "What! We can kill as well as
\par the men when the place is taken!" And to her, with a shrill thirsty
\par cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
\par revenge.
\par 
\par Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
\par drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight
\par displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing
\par weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work
\par at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,
\par execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the
\par furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the
\par single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great
\par towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot
\par by the service of Four fierce hours.
\par 
\par A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly
\par perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly
\par the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the
\par wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer
\par walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!
\par 
\par So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to
\par draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
\par struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the
\par outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he
\par made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side;
\par Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the
\par inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult,
\par exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet
\par furious dumb-show.
\par 
\par "The Prisoners!"
\par 
\par "The Records!"
\par 
\par "The secret cells!"
\par 
\par "The instruments of torture!"
\par 
\par "The Prisoners!"
\par 
\par Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, "The Prisoners!" was
\par the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an
\par eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost
\par billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and
\par threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
\par undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
\par these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his
\par hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the
\par wall.
\par 
\par "Show me the North Tower!" said Defarge. "Quick!"
\par 
\par "I will faithfully," replied the man, "if you will come with me. But
\par there is no one there."
\par 
\par "What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?" asked
\par Defarge. "Quick!"
\par 
\par "The meaning, monsieur?"
\par 
\par "Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I
\par shall strike you dead?"
\par 
\par "Kill him!" croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.
\par 
\par "Monsieur, it is a cell."
\par 
\par "Show it me!"
\par 
\par "Pass this way, then."
\par 
\par Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed
\par by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,
\par held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's. Their three heads had
\par been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much
\par as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the
\par noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and
\par its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around
\par outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,
\par occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
\par air like spray.
\par 
\par Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past
\par hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
\par and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry
\par waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,
\par linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and
\par there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;
\par but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
\par tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls
\par and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
\par to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had
\par come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.
\par 
\par The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung
\par the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed
\par in:
\par 
\par "One hundred and five, North Tower!"
\par 
\par There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
\par with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by
\par stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred
\par across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
\par on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were
\par the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.
\par 
\par "Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them," said
\par Defarge to the turnkey.
\par 
\par The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.
\par 
\par "Stop!--Look here, Jacques!"
\par 
\par "A. M.!" croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.
\par 
\par "Alexandre Manette," said Defarge in his ear, following the letters
\par with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. "And here he
\par wrote 'a poor physician.' And it was he, without doubt, who scratched
\par a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it
\par me!"
\par 
\par He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden
\par exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and
\par table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.
\par 
\par "Hold the light higher!" he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. "Look
\par among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,"
\par throwing it to him; "rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the
\par light higher, you!"
\par 
\par With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and,
\par peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,
\par and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar
\par and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and
\par in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney
\par into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a
\par cautious touch.
\par 
\par "Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?"
\par 
\par "Nothing."
\par 
\par "Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light
\par them, you!"
\par 
\par The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping
\par again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and
\par retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense
\par of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once
\par more.
\par 
\par They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint
\par Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard
\par upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.
\par Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for
\par judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's
\par blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be
\par unavenged.
\par 
\par In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
\par encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
\par decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a
\par woman's. "See, there is my husband!" she cried, pointing him out.
\par "See Defarge!" She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and
\par remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through
\par the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable
\par close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to
\par be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the
\par long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him
\par when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot
\par upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.
\par 
\par The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea
\par of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint
\par Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
\par iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the
\par governor's body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge
\par where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. "Lower
\par the lamp yonder!" cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new
\par means of death; "here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!" The
\par swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.
\par 
\par The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving
\par of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
\par were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,
\par voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
\par until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.
\par 
\par But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
\par in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so
\par fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore
\par more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly
\par released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high
\par overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last
\par Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
\par Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose
\par drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive
\par faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;
\par faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped
\par lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, "THOU DIDST
\par IT!"
\par 
\par Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the
\par accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters
\par and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken
\par hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint
\par Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven
\par hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay,
\par and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad,
\par and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
\par at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once
\par stained red.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XXII. The Sea Still Rises
\par 
\par 
\par Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
\par his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with
\par the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame
\par Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
\par Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of
\par Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
\par themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets had a
\par portentously elastic swing with them.
\par 
\par Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,
\par contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several
\par knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense
\par of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on
\par the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: "I know how
\par hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;
\par but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
\par destroy life in you?" Every lean bare arm, that had been without work
\par before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
\par The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that
\par they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;
\par the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the
\par last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.
\par 
\par Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was
\par to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her
\par sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved
\par grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had
\par already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.
\par 
\par "Hark!" said The Vengeance. "Listen, then! Who comes?"
\par 
\par As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine
\par Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading
\par murmur came rushing along.
\par 
\par "It is Defarge," said madame. "Silence, patriots!"
\par 
\par Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked
\par around him! "Listen, everywhere!" said madame again. "Listen to him!"
\par Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open
\par mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had
\par sprung to their feet.
\par 
\par "Say then, my husband. What is it?"
\par 
\par "News from the other world!"
\par 
\par "How, then?" cried madame, contemptuously. "The other world?"
\par 
\par "Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people
\par that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?"
\par 
\par "Everybody!" from all throats.
\par 
\par "The news is of him. He is among us!"
\par 
\par "Among us!" from the universal throat again. "And dead?"
\par 
\par "Not dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself
\par to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have
\par found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have
\par seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have
\par said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he reason?"
\par 
\par Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had
\par never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
\par could have heard the answering cry.
\par 
\par A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked
\par steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum
\par was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.
\par 
\par "Patriots!" said Defarge, in a determined voice, "are we ready?"
\par 
\par Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating
\par in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and
\par The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about
\par her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to
\par house, rousing the women.
\par 
\par The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked
\par from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
\par the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From
\par such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their
\par children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
\par famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one
\par another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.
\par Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant
\par Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of
\par these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon
\par alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon
\par who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread
\par to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
\par breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our
\par suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my
\par knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,
\par and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,
\par Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend
\par Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from
\par him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,
\par whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
\par dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men
\par belonging to them from being trampled under foot.
\par 
\par Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at
\par the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew
\par his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out
\par of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with
\par such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not
\par a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the
\par wailing children.
\par 
\par No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where
\par this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent
\par open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,
\par and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance
\par from him in the Hall.
\par 
\par "See!" cried madame, pointing with her knife. "See the old villain bound
\par with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.
\par Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!" Madame put her knife
\par under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.
\par 
\par The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of
\par her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to
\par others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the
\par clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,
\par and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent
\par expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at
\par a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some
\par wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
\par to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a
\par telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.
\par 
\par At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
\par protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head. The favour was
\par too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
\par stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got
\par him!
\par 
\par It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge
\par had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable
\par wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned
\par her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and
\par Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows
\par had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high
\par perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, "Bring him
\par out! Bring him to the lamp!"
\par 
\par Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on
\par his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,
\par and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
\par face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always
\par entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of
\par action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
\par another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
\par a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
\par of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat
\par might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him
\par while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately
\par screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have
\par him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope
\par broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope
\par broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and
\par held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the
\par mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.
\par 
\par Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted
\par and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when
\par the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the
\par people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
\par five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes
\par on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the
\par breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on
\par pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession
\par through the streets.
\par 
\par Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,
\par wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by
\par long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
\par they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
\par embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
\par again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
\par frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
\par slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
\par common, afterwards supping at their doors.
\par 
\par Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
\par most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
\par some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
\par cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
\par share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
\par and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
\par hoped.
\par 
\par It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last
\par knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in
\par husky tones, while fastening the door:
\par 
\par "At last it is come, my dear!"
\par 
\par "Eh well!" returned madame. "Almost."
\par 
\par Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with
\par her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum's was the
\par only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The
\par Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had
\par the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
\par was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
\par Antoine's bosom.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XXIII. Fire Rises
\par 
\par 
\par There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where
\par the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
\par highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
\par poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the
\par crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
\par but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of
\par them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not
\par be what he was ordered.
\par 
\par Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
\par Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as
\par shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,
\par dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated
\par animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn
\par out.
\par 
\par Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national
\par blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
\par luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;
\par nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought
\par things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
\par Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must
\par be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it
\par was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
\par flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
\par its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing
\par to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
\par unaccountable.
\par 
\par But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like
\par it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
\par it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures
\par of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting
\par the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces
\par of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in
\par the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the
\par disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
\par beautifying features of Monseigneur.
\par 
\par For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the
\par dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and
\par to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in
\par thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
\par he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,
\par and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on
\par foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now
\par a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern
\par without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
\par aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
\par mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many
\par highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled
\par with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.
\par 
\par Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,
\par as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he
\par could get from a shower of hail.
\par 
\par The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill,
\par and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects
\par in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just
\par intelligible:
\par 
\par "How goes it, Jacques?"
\par 
\par "All well, Jacques."
\par 
\par "Touch then!"
\par 
\par They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.
\par 
\par "No dinner?"
\par 
\par "Nothing but supper now," said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.
\par 
\par "It is the fashion," growled the man. "I meet no dinner anywhere."
\par 
\par He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and
\par steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held
\par it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
\par thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.
\par 
\par "Touch then." It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
\par time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.
\par 
\par "To-night?" said the mender of roads.
\par 
\par "To-night," said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.
\par 
\par "Where?"
\par 
\par "Here."
\par 
\par He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
\par one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
\par of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.
\par 
\par "Show me!" said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.
\par 
\par "See!" returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. "You go down
\par here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--"
\par 
\par "To the Devil with all that!" interrupted the other, rolling his eye
\par over the landscape. "_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.
\par Well?"
\par 
\par "Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
\par village."
\par 
\par "Good. When do you cease to work?"
\par 
\par "At sunset."
\par 
\par "Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without
\par resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you
\par wake me?"
\par 
\par "Surely."
\par 
\par The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his
\par great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He
\par was fast asleep directly.
\par 
\par As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling
\par away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
\par by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap
\par now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the
\par heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used
\par his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.
\par The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen
\par red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of
\par beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen
\par and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender
\par of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were
\par footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed
\par with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long
\par leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into
\par sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at
\par secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept
\par with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.
\par Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and
\par drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against
\par this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
\par looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no
\par obstacle, tending to centres all over France.
\par 
\par The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
\par brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps
\par of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
\par them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,
\par the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
\par to go down into the village, roused him.
\par 
\par "Good!" said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. "Two leagues beyond the
\par summit of the hill?"
\par 
\par "About."
\par 
\par "About. Good!"
\par 
\par The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him
\par according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,
\par squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and
\par appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.
\par When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,
\par as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A
\par curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered
\par together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of
\par looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,
\par chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top
\par alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his
\par chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to
\par the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need
\par to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.
\par 
\par The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its
\par solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened
\par the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace
\par flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a
\par swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through
\par the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the
\par stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis
\par had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
\par heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
\par branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four
\par lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
\par was black again.
\par 
\par But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely
\par visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
\par Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,
\par picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,
\par and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.
\par Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the
\par stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.
\par 
\par A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
\par there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was
\par spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the
\par space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur
\par Gabelle's door. "Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!" The tocsin rang
\par impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The
\par mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood
\par with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the
\par sky. "It must be forty feet high," said they, grimly; and never moved.
\par 
\par The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
\par through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
\par the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;
\par removed from them, a group of soldiers. "Help, gentlemen--officers! The
\par chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
\par timely aid! Help, help!" The officers looked towards the soldiers who
\par looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
\par of lips, "It must burn."
\par 
\par As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
\par village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and
\par fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
\par lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in
\par every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,
\par occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
\par Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
\par that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to
\par authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,
\par and that post-horses would roast.
\par 
\par The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and
\par raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the
\par infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising
\par and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in
\par torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the
\par two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke
\par again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake
\par and contending with the fire.
\par 
\par The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
\par scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce
\par figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten
\par lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran
\par dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
\par heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and
\par splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied
\par birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures
\par trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded
\par roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next
\par destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,
\par abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.
\par 
\par Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
\par bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
\par the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
\par of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter
\par days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his
\par house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
\par Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
\par with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
\par withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
\par resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man
\par of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the
\par parapet, and crush a man or two below.
\par 
\par Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
\par distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,
\par combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
\par ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
\par which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
\par A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
\par the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
\par Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
\par rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,
\par and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
\par while.
\par 
\par Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
\par other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom
\par the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they
\par had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
\par less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the
\par functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up
\par in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
\par North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
\par The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
\par no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
\par successfully.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock
\par 
\par 
\par In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by
\par the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
\par flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on
\par the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays
\par of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
\par tissue of the life of her home.
\par 
\par Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
\par the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
\par feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
\par a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
\par danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
\par in.
\par 
\par Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
\par his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as
\par to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and
\par this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
\par infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
\par ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
\par boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
\par and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no
\par sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.
\par 
\par The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the
\par mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good
\par eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride,
\par Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness--but it had dropped
\par out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its
\par outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was
\par all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and
\par "suspended," when the last tidings came over.
\par 
\par The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was
\par come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.
\par 
\par As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of
\par Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. Spirits are supposed to
\par haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur
\par without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.
\par Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most
\par to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a munificent
\par house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
\par from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming
\par storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made
\par provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there
\par by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer
\par from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as
\par a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that
\par time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this
\par was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in
\par consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news
\par out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran
\par through Temple Bar to read.
\par 
\par On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles
\par Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The
\par penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now
\par the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an
\par hour or so of the time of closing.
\par 
\par "But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived," said Charles
\par Darnay, rather hesitating, "I must still suggest to you--"
\par 
\par "I understand. That I am too old?" said Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
\par disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you."
\par 
\par "My dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, "you touch
\par some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe
\par enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
\par upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
\par interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a
\par disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
\par House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of
\par old, and is in Tellson's confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the
\par long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
\par myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all
\par these years, who ought to be?"
\par 
\par "I wish I were going myself," said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,
\par and like one thinking aloud.
\par 
\par "Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!" exclaimed Mr.
\par Lorry. "You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You
\par are a wise counsellor."
\par 
\par "My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the
\par thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through
\par my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for
\par the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them," he spoke
\par here in his former thoughtful manner, "that one might be listened to,
\par and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night,
\par after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--"
\par 
\par "When you were talking to Lucie," Mr. Lorry repeated. "Yes. I wonder you
\par are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to
\par France at this time of day!"
\par 
\par "However, I am not going," said Charles Darnay, with a smile. "It is
\par more to the purpose that you say you are."
\par 
\par "And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles," Mr. Lorry
\par glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, "you can have no
\par conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and
\par of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The
\par Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
\par of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they
\par might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set
\par afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these
\par with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise
\par getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of
\par precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall
\par I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose
\par bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about
\par the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!"
\par 
\par "How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry."
\par 
\par "Tut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, glancing at
\par the House again, "you are to remember, that getting things out of
\par Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an
\par impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought
\par to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to
\par whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine,
\par every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed
\par the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily
\par as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped."
\par 
\par "And do you really go to-night?"
\par 
\par "I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of
\par delay."
\par 
\par "And do you take no one with you?"
\par 
\par "All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing
\par to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my
\par bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
\par Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
\par of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
\par master."
\par 
\par "I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and
\par youthfulness."
\par 
\par "I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little
\par commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and
\par live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old."
\par 
\par This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with
\par Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he
\par would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too
\par much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it
\par was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this
\par terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
\par the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or
\par omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched
\par millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that
\par should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,
\par years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such
\par vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the
\par restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,
\par and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured
\par without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was
\par such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood
\par in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had
\par already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.
\par 
\par Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his
\par way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
\par to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
\par them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
\par accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
\par of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard
\par with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between
\par going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his
\par word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.
\par 
\par The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter
\par before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
\par whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay
\par that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right
\par name. The address, turned into English, ran:
\par 
\par "Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of
\par France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
\par London, England."
\par 
\par On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and
\par express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should
\par be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate
\par between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no
\par suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.
\par 
\par "No," said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; "I have referred it,
\par I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this
\par gentleman is to be found."
\par 
\par The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there
\par was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk. He
\par held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
\par person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at
\par it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
\par and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
\par English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.
\par 
\par "Nephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the
\par polished Marquis who was murdered," said one. "Happy to say, I never
\par knew him."
\par 
\par "A craven who abandoned his post," said another--this Monseigneur had
\par been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of
\par hay--"some years ago."
\par 
\par "Infected with the new doctrines," said a third, eyeing the direction
\par through his glass in passing; "set himself in opposition to the last
\par Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to
\par the ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves."
\par 
\par "Hey?" cried the blatant Stryver. "Did he though? Is that the sort of
\par fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!"
\par 
\par Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on
\par the shoulder, and said:
\par 
\par "I know the fellow."
\par 
\par "Do you, by Jupiter?" said Stryver. "I am sorry for it."
\par 
\par "Why?"
\par 
\par "Why, Mr. Darnay? D'ye hear what he did? Don't ask, why, in these
\par times."
\par 
\par "But I do ask why?"
\par 
\par "Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to
\par hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,
\par who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
\par ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth
\par that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a
\par man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry
\par because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's
\par why."
\par 
\par Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and
\par said: "You may not understand the gentleman."
\par 
\par "I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay," said Bully
\par Stryver, "and I'll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don't_
\par understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also
\par tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
\par to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,
\par gentlemen," said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers,
\par "I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never
\par find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such
\par precious _proteges_. No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair
\par of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away."
\par 
\par With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver
\par shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of
\par his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk,
\par in the general departure from the Bank.
\par 
\par "Will you take charge of the letter?" said Mr. Lorry. "You know where to
\par deliver it?"
\par 
\par "I do."
\par 
\par "Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
\par addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
\par that it has been here some time?"
\par 
\par "I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?"
\par 
\par "From here, at eight."
\par 
\par "I will come back, to see you off."
\par 
\par Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
\par Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the
\par letter, and read it. These were its contents:
\par 
\par 
\par "Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.
\par 
\par "June 21, 1792. "MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.
\par 
\par "After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
\par village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and
\par brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a
\par great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the
\par ground.
\par 
\par "The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
\par and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my
\par life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against
\par the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an
\par emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not
\par against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that,
\par before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
\par imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
\par had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for
\par an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?
\par 
\par "Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that
\par emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he
\par not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
\par I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your
\par ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!
\par 
\par "For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
\par your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to
\par succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh
\par Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!
\par 
\par "From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and
\par nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the
\par assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.
\par 
\par "Your afflicted,
\par 
\par "Gabelle."
\par 
\par 
\par The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life
\par by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose
\par only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so
\par reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple
\par considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.
\par 
\par He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
\par the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his
\par resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his
\par conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,
\par he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,
\par his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own
\par mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have
\par systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to
\par do it, and that it had never been done.
\par 
\par The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being
\par always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time
\par which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
\par annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week
\par following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of
\par these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still
\par without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched
\par the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled
\par until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from
\par France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of
\par confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,
\par was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
\par France that might impeach him for it.
\par 
\par But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so
\par far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
\par relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
\par favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own
\par bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
\par on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
\par there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
\par in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
\par the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
\par own safety, so that it could not but appear now.
\par 
\par This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,
\par that he would go to Paris.
\par 
\par Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven
\par him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him
\par to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted
\par him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
\par attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
\par worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who
\par could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,
\par trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
\par and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
\par him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
\par brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
\par (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
\par which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
\par coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle's
\par letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
\par justice, honour, and good name.
\par 
\par His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.
\par 
\par Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he
\par struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention
\par with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left
\par it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be
\par gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert
\par it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the
\par sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even
\par saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
\par Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.
\par 
\par As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that
\par neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.
\par Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always
\par reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,
\par should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in
\par the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his
\par situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety
\par to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not
\par discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence
\par in his course.
\par 
\par He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
\par return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived
\par in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
\par nothing of his intention now.
\par 
\par A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was
\par booted and equipped.
\par 
\par "I have delivered that letter," said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. "I
\par would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
\par perhaps you will take a verbal one?"
\par 
\par "That I will, and readily," said Mr. Lorry, "if it is not dangerous."
\par 
\par "Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye."
\par 
\par "What is his name?" said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his
\par hand.
\par 
\par "Gabelle."
\par 
\par "Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?"
\par 
\par "Simply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come.'"
\par 
\par "Any time mentioned?"
\par 
\par "He will start upon his journey to-morrow night."
\par 
\par "Any person mentioned?"
\par 
\par "No."
\par 
\par He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,
\par and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the
\par misty air of Fleet-street. "My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie," said
\par Mr. Lorry at parting, "and take precious care of them till I come back."
\par Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage
\par rolled away.
\par 
\par That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote
\par two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation
\par he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons
\par that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
\par personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and
\par their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the
\par strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters
\par in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.
\par 
\par It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first
\par reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to
\par preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.
\par But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him
\par resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,
\par so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and
\par the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her
\par scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye
\par (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise
\par of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
\par streets, with a heavier heart.
\par 
\par The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides
\par and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his
\par two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
\par midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.
\par "For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
\par your noble name!" was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened
\par his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and
\par floated away for the Loadstone Rock.

\par I. In Secret
\par 
\par 
\par The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
\par England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
\par ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
\par horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and
\par unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;
\par but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
\par these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of
\par citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state
\par of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,
\par inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,
\par turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in
\par hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
\par Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
\par Death.
\par 
\par A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles
\par Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
\par was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
\par at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end.
\par Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across
\par the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in
\par the series that was barred between him and England. The universal
\par watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,
\par or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have
\par felt his freedom more completely gone.
\par 
\par This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
\par times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by
\par riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him
\par by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been
\par days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in
\par a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.
\par 
\par Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his
\par prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the
\par guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
\par to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as
\par a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
\par had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.
\par 
\par Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
\par red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.
\par 
\par "Emigrant," said the functionary, "I am going to send you on to Paris,
\par under an escort."
\par 
\par "Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
\par dispense with the escort."
\par 
\par "Silence!" growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end
\par of his musket. "Peace, aristocrat!"
\par 
\par "It is as the good patriot says," observed the timid functionary. "You
\par are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it."
\par 
\par "I have no choice," said Charles Darnay.
\par 
\par "Choice! Listen to him!" cried the same scowling red-cap. "As if it was
\par not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!"
\par 
\par "It is always as the good patriot says," observed the functionary. "Rise
\par and dress yourself, emigrant."
\par 
\par Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other
\par patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by
\par a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
\par started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.
\par 
\par The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
\par cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either
\par side of him.
\par 
\par The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to
\par his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
\par wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
\par faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
\par and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without
\par change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay
\par between them and the capital.
\par 
\par They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and
\par lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,
\par that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
\par shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of
\par being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger
\par as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying
\par his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint
\par that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,
\par he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
\par of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,
\par confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.
\par 
\par But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,
\par when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from
\par himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd
\par gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called
\par out loudly, "Down with the emigrant!"
\par 
\par He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,
\par resuming it as his safest place, said:
\par 
\par "Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own
\par will?"
\par 
\par "You are a cursed emigrant," cried a farrier, making at him in a
\par furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; "and you are a cursed
\par aristocrat!"
\par 
\par The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's
\par bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, "Let him
\par be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris."
\par 
\par "Judged!" repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. "Ay! and condemned
\par as a traitor." At this the crowd roared approval.
\par 
\par Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse's head to the
\par yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with
\par the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his
\par voice heard:
\par 
\par "Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a
\par traitor."
\par 
\par "He lies!" cried the smith. "He is a traitor since the decree. His life
\par is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!"
\par 
\par At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which
\par another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his
\par horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks,
\par and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier
\par struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no
\par more was done.
\par 
\par "What is this decree that the smith spoke of?" Darnay asked the
\par postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.
\par 
\par "Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants."
\par 
\par "When passed?"
\par 
\par "On the fourteenth."
\par 
\par "The day I left England!"
\par 
\par "Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
\par others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and
\par condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said
\par your life was not your own."
\par 
\par "But there are no such decrees yet?"
\par 
\par "What do I know!" said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; "there
\par may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?"
\par 
\par They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and
\par then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many
\par wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
\par unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and
\par lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor
\par cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and
\par would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
\par circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn
\par up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in
\par Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
\par into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and
\par wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
\par that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by
\par the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
\par way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.
\par 
\par Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was
\par closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.
\par 
\par "Where are the papers of this prisoner?" demanded a resolute-looking man
\par in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.
\par 
\par Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the
\par speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,
\par in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
\par imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.
\par 
\par "Where," repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him
\par whatever, "are the papers of this prisoner?"
\par 
\par The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his
\par eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some
\par disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.
\par 
\par He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went
\par into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the
\par gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles
\par Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
\par patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress
\par into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar
\par traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest
\par people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not
\par to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue
\par forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they
\par filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew
\par their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the
\par ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered
\par about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men
\par and women.
\par 
\par When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
\par things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,
\par who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the
\par escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him
\par to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,
\par turned and rode away without entering the city.
\par 
\par He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine
\par and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,
\par drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and
\par waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The
\par light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of
\par the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly
\par uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
\par officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.
\par 
\par "Citizen Defarge," said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of
\par paper to write on. "Is this the emigrant Evremonde?"
\par 
\par "This is the man."
\par 
\par "Your age, Evremonde?"
\par 
\par "Thirty-seven."
\par 
\par "Married, Evremonde?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par "Where married?"
\par 
\par "In England."
\par 
\par "Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?"
\par 
\par "In England."
\par 
\par "Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La
\par Force."
\par 
\par "Just Heaven!" exclaimed Darnay. "Under what law, and for what offence?"
\par 
\par The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.
\par 
\par "We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here." He
\par said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.
\par 
\par "I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response
\par to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I
\par demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that
\par my right?"
\par 
\par "Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde," was the stolid reply. The officer
\par wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,
\par sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words "In secret."
\par 
\par Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
\par him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended
\par them.
\par 
\par "Is it you," said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
\par guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, "who married the daughter of
\par Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?"
\par 
\par "Yes," replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.
\par 
\par "My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint
\par Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me."
\par 
\par "My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!"
\par 
\par The word "wife" seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say
\par with sudden impatience, "In the name of that sharp female newly-born,
\par and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?"
\par 
\par "You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the
\par truth?"
\par 
\par "A bad truth for you," said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and
\par looking straight before him.
\par 
\par "Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
\par sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a
\par little help?"
\par 
\par "None." Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.
\par 
\par "Will you answer me a single question?"
\par 
\par "Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is."
\par 
\par "In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
\par communication with the world outside?"
\par 
\par "You will see."
\par 
\par "I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
\par presenting my case?"
\par 
\par "You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried
\par in worse prisons, before now."
\par 
\par "But never by me, Citizen Defarge."
\par 
\par Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady
\par and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope
\par there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.
\par He, therefore, made haste to say:
\par 
\par "It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better
\par than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to
\par Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,
\par the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the
\par prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?"
\par 
\par "I will do," Defarge doggedly rejoined, "nothing for you. My duty is to
\par my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.
\par I will do nothing for you."
\par 
\par Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
\par was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see
\par how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
\par streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned
\par their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;
\par otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no
\par more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
\par going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they
\par passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited
\par audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal
\par family. The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first made
\par it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the
\par foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at
\par Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal
\par watchfulness had completely isolated him.
\par 
\par That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
\par developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That
\par perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster
\par yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he
\par might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events
\par of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by
\par the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future
\par was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant
\par hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few
\par rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
\par garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
\par been a hundred thousand years away. The "sharp female newly-born, and
\par called La Guillotine," was hardly known to him, or to the generality
\par of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were
\par probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could
\par they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?
\par 
\par Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation
\par from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the
\par certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on
\par his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he
\par arrived at the prison of La Force.
\par 
\par A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge
\par presented "The Emigrant Evremonde."
\par 
\par "What the Devil! How many more of them!" exclaimed the man with the
\par bloated face.
\par 
\par Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,
\par with his two fellow-patriots.
\par 
\par "What the Devil, I say again!" exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.
\par "How many more!"
\par 
\par The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely
\par replied, "One must have patience, my dear!" Three turnkeys who entered
\par responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, "For
\par the love of Liberty;" which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
\par conclusion.
\par 
\par The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a
\par horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome
\par flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that
\par are ill cared for!
\par 
\par "In secret, too," grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. "As
\par if I was not already full to bursting!"
\par 
\par He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
\par awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
\par fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
\par either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
\par subordinates.
\par 
\par "Come!" said the chief, at length taking up his keys, "come with me,
\par emigrant."
\par 
\par Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by
\par corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,
\par until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
\par prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading
\par and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
\par most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the
\par room.
\par 
\par In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
\par disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning
\par unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to
\par receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with
\par all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.
\par 
\par So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
\par gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
\par misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand
\par in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost
\par of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of
\par frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
\par waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
\par that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.
\par 
\par It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other
\par gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance
\par in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly
\par coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
\par there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the
\par mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and
\par likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its
\par utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress
\par of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!
\par 
\par "In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune," said a
\par gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, "I have the
\par honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you
\par on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate
\par happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,
\par to ask your name and condition?"
\par 
\par Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in
\par words as suitable as he could find.
\par 
\par "But I hope," said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
\par eyes, who moved across the room, "that you are not in secret?"
\par 
\par "I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say
\par so."
\par 
\par "Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several
\par members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted
\par but a short time." Then he added, raising his voice, "I grieve to inform
\par the society--in secret."
\par 
\par There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room
\par to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among
\par which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave
\par him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to
\par render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and
\par the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.
\par 
\par The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had
\par ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted
\par them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a
\par solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.
\par 
\par "Yours," said the gaoler.
\par 
\par "Why am I confined alone?"
\par 
\par "How do I know!"
\par 
\par "I can buy pen, ink, and paper?"
\par 
\par "Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At
\par present, you may buy your food, and nothing more."
\par 
\par There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As
\par the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
\par walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
\par the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
\par was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
\par a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was
\par gone, he thought in the same wandering way, "Now am I left, as if I were
\par dead." Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it
\par with a sick feeling, and thought, "And here in these crawling creatures
\par is the first condition of the body after death."
\par 
\par "Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
\par paces by four and a half." The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
\par counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
\par drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. "He made shoes, he made
\par shoes, he made shoes." The prisoner counted the measurement again, and
\par paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.
\par "The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among
\par them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the
\par embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden
\par hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake,
\par through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He
\par made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and
\par a half." With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
\par his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting
\par and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it
\par still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he
\par knew, in the swell that rose above them.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par II. The Grindstone
\par 
\par 
\par Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was
\par in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
\par the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to
\par a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the
\par troubles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders. A
\par mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his
\par metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation
\par of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
\par besides the cook in question.
\par 
\par Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the
\par sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and
\par willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and
\par indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's
\par house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all
\par things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce
\par precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month
\par of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
\par Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were
\par drinking brandy in its state apartments.
\par 
\par A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris,
\par would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.
\par For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have
\par said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid
\par over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson's had whitewashed the
\par Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest
\par linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to
\par night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in
\par Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
\par the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and
\par also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest
\par provocation. Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things
\par exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had
\par taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.
\par 
\par What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would
\par lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in
\par Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,
\par and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
\par Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
\par the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
\par Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by
\par a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was
\par prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a
\par deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the
\par room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.
\par 
\par He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which
\par he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they
\par derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
\par building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about
\par that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did
\par his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,
\par was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages
\par of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two
\par great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the
\par open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared
\par to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,
\par or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless
\par objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had
\par opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and
\par he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.
\par 
\par From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came
\par the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring
\par in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
\par nature were going up to Heaven.
\par 
\par "Thank God," said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, "that no one near and
\par dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all
\par who are in danger!"
\par 
\par Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,
\par "They have come back!" and sat listening. But, there was no loud
\par irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate
\par clash again, and all was quiet.
\par 
\par The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
\par uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
\par awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to
\par go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly
\par opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in
\par amazement.
\par 
\par Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with
\par that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
\par seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
\par force and power to it in this one passage of her life.
\par 
\par "What is this?" cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. "What is the
\par matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?
\par What is it?"
\par 
\par With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted
\par out in his arms, imploringly, "O my dear friend! My husband!"
\par 
\par "Your husband, Lucie?"
\par 
\par "Charles."
\par 
\par "What of Charles?"
\par 
\par "Here.
\par 
\par "Here, in Paris?"
\par 
\par "Has been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't
\par collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
\par us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison."
\par 
\par The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the
\par bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices
\par came pouring into the courtyard.
\par 
\par "What is that noise?" said the Doctor, turning towards the window.
\par 
\par "Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry. "Don't look out! Manette, for your life,
\par don't touch the blind!"
\par 
\par The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and
\par said, with a cool, bold smile:
\par 
\par "My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been
\par a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In
\par France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would
\par touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
\par My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
\par barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I
\par knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I
\par told Lucie so.--What is that noise?" His hand was again upon the window.
\par 
\par "Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. "No, Lucie, my
\par dear, nor you!" He got his arm round her, and held her. "Don't be so
\par terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
\par having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in
\par this fatal place. What prison is he in?"
\par 
\par "La Force!"
\par 
\par "La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in
\par your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to
\par do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or
\par I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;
\par you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you
\par to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must
\par instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a
\par room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for
\par two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not
\par delay."
\par 
\par "I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do
\par nothing else than this. I know you are true."
\par 
\par The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the
\par key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and
\par partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm, and
\par looked out with him into the courtyard.
\par 
\par Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near
\par enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The
\par people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they
\par had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up
\par there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.
\par 
\par But, such awful workers, and such awful work!
\par 
\par The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two
\par men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
\par the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than
\par the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
\par False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their
\par hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with
\par howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
\par sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung
\par forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women
\par held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping
\par blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks
\par struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
\par fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
\par the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the
\par sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all
\par over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain
\par upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace
\par and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through
\par and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be
\par sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to
\par the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments
\par of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And
\par as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
\par of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in
\par their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
\par given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.
\par 
\par All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of
\par any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
\par were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for
\par explanation in his friend's ashy face.
\par 
\par "They are," Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at
\par the locked room, "murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you
\par say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you
\par have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It
\par may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!"
\par 
\par Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,
\par and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.
\par 
\par His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
\par confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,
\par carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
\par For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
\par the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,
\par surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all
\par linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with
\par cries of--"Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner's
\par kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save
\par the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!" and a thousand answering shouts.
\par 
\par He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
\par and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was
\par assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found
\par her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
\par surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat
\par watching them in such quiet as the night knew.
\par 
\par Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
\par clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own
\par bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
\par charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O
\par the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!
\par 
\par Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the
\par irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
\par "What is it?" cried Lucie, affrighted. "Hush! The soldiers' swords are
\par sharpened there," said Mr. Lorry. "The place is national property now,
\par and used as a kind of armoury, my love."
\par 
\par Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
\par Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself
\par from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so
\par besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
\par to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by
\par the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.
\par Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
\par the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
\par climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its
\par dainty cushions.
\par 
\par The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,
\par and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood
\par alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had
\par never given, and would never take away.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par III. The Shadow
\par 
\par 
\par One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.
\par Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to
\par imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
\par the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
\par for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust
\par he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict
\par man of business.
\par 
\par At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out
\par the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
\par the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the
\par same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the
\par most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
\par its dangerous workings.
\par 
\par Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay
\par tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said
\par that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that
\par Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to
\par this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and
\par he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
\par went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
\par in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
\par of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.
\par 
\par To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:
\par giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.
\par He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
\par considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.
\par A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly
\par and heavily the day lagged on with him.
\par 
\par It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He
\par was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to
\par do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a
\par man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
\par addressed him by his name.
\par 
\par "Your servant," said Mr. Lorry. "Do you know me?"
\par 
\par He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
\par to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of
\par emphasis, the words:
\par 
\par "Do you know me?"
\par 
\par "I have seen you somewhere."
\par 
\par "Perhaps at my wine-shop?"
\par 
\par Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: "You come from Doctor
\par Manette?"
\par 
\par "Yes. I come from Doctor Manette."
\par 
\par "And what says he? What does he send me?"
\par 
\par Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the
\par words in the Doctor's writing:
\par 
\par     "Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.
\par      I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
\par      from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife."
\par 
\par It was dated from La Force, within an hour.
\par 
\par "Will you accompany me," said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading
\par this note aloud, "to where his wife resides?"
\par 
\par "Yes," returned Defarge.
\par 
\par Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
\par way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
\par courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.
\par 
\par "Madame Defarge, surely!" said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly
\par the same attitude some seventeen years ago.
\par 
\par "It is she," observed her husband.
\par 
\par "Does Madame go with us?" inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as
\par they moved.
\par 
\par "Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.
\par It is for their safety."
\par 
\par Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously
\par at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being
\par The Vengeance.
\par 
\par They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,
\par ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,
\par and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the
\par tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that
\par delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in
\par the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.
\par 
\par      "DEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has
\par       influence around me.  You cannot answer this.
\par       Kiss our child for me."
\par 
\par That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received
\par it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the
\par hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
\par action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
\par to its knitting again.
\par 
\par There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in
\par the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her
\par neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted
\par eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.
\par 
\par "My dear," said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; "there are frequent
\par risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever
\par trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
\par to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she
\par may identify them. I believe," said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his
\par reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
\par upon him more and more, "I state the case, Citizen Defarge?"
\par 
\par Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a
\par gruff sound of acquiescence.
\par 
\par "You had better, Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to
\par propitiate, by tone and manner, "have the dear child here, and our
\par good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no
\par French."
\par 
\par The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
\par match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,
\par appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,
\par whom her eyes first encountered, "Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope
\par _you_ are pretty well!" She also bestowed a British cough on Madame
\par Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.
\par 
\par "Is that his child?" said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the
\par first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it
\par were the finger of Fate.
\par 
\par "Yes, madame," answered Mr. Lorry; "this is our poor prisoner's darling
\par daughter, and only child."
\par 
\par The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so
\par threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively
\par kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The
\par shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,
\par threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.
\par 
\par "It is enough, my husband," said Madame Defarge. "I have seen them. We
\par may go."
\par 
\par But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and
\par presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as
\par she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:
\par 
\par "You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will
\par help me to see him if you can?"
\par 
\par "Your husband is not my business here," returned Madame Defarge, looking
\par down at her with perfect composure. "It is the daughter of your father
\par who is my business here."
\par 
\par "For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She
\par will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more
\par afraid of you than of these others."
\par 
\par Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.
\par Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,
\par collected his face into a sterner expression.
\par 
\par "What is it that your husband says in that little letter?" asked Madame
\par Defarge, with a lowering smile. "Influence; he says something touching
\par influence?"
\par 
\par "That my father," said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her
\par breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, "has
\par much influence around him."
\par 
\par "Surely it will release him!" said Madame Defarge. "Let it do so."
\par 
\par "As a wife and mother," cried Lucie, most earnestly, "I implore you to
\par have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against
\par my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think
\par of me. As a wife and mother!"
\par 
\par Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
\par turning to her friend The Vengeance:
\par 
\par "The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little
\par as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have
\par known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,
\par often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in
\par themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
\par sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?"
\par 
\par "We have seen nothing else," returned The Vengeance.
\par 
\par "We have borne this a long time," said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes
\par again upon Lucie. "Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife
\par and mother would be much to us now?"
\par 
\par She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge
\par went last, and closed the door.
\par 
\par "Courage, my dear Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. "Courage,
\par courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of
\par late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart."
\par 
\par "I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
\par shadow on me and on all my hopes."
\par 
\par "Tut, tut!" said Mr. Lorry; "what is this despondency in the brave
\par little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie."
\par 
\par But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,
\par for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par IV. Calm in Storm
\par 
\par 
\par Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
\par absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
\par kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that
\par not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she
\par know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
\par ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been
\par darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been
\par tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon
\par the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that
\par some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.
\par 
\par To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
\par which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a
\par scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had
\par found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were
\par brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
\par to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back
\par to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he
\par had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
\par years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the
\par body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this
\par man was Defarge.
\par 
\par That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,
\par that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard
\par to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some
\par dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life
\par and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
\par a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded
\par to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and
\par examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when
\par the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible
\par to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,
\par the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that
\par the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held
\par inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
\par was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the
\par Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
\par assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,
\par delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
\par often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and
\par had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.
\par 
\par The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
\par intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were
\par saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
\par those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had
\par been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had
\par thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress
\par the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him
\par in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies
\par of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
\par awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man
\par with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him
\par carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged
\par anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes
\par with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.
\par 
\par As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of
\par his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that
\par such dread experiences would revive the old danger.
\par 
\par But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never
\par at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor
\par felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time
\par he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which
\par could break the prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him.
\par "It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
\par As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be
\par helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
\par of Heaven I will do it!" Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw
\par the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
\par of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a
\par clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
\par had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.
\par 
\par Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would
\par have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself
\par in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees
\par of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his
\par personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician
\par of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie
\par that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the
\par general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet
\par messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself
\par sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was
\par not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of
\par plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
\par known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.
\par 
\par This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the
\par sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
\par Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
\par but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that
\par time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
\par and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
\par Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through
\par that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's
\par ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,
\par that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to
\par trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself
\par and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
\par affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in
\par rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. "All
\par curious to see," thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, "but all
\par natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it
\par couldn't be in better hands."
\par 
\par But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
\par Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,
\par the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new
\par era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of
\par Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death
\par against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the
\par great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
\par against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils
\par of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and
\par had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and
\par alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of
\par the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds
\par and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the
\par fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.
\par What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year
\par One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,
\par and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!
\par 
\par There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no
\par measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when
\par time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other
\par count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever
\par of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the
\par unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the
\par head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
\par head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
\par widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.
\par 
\par And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
\par all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A
\par revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand
\par revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,
\par which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over
\par any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged
\par with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;
\par these things became the established order and nature of appointed
\par things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
\par Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
\par the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the
\par sharp female called La Guillotine.
\par 
\par It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,
\par it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a
\par peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which
\par shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window
\par and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the
\par human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts
\par from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and
\par believed in where the Cross was denied.
\par 
\par It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,
\par were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young
\par Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed
\par the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and
\par good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one
\par dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.
\par The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief
\par functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his
\par namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every
\par day.
\par 
\par Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked
\par with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his
\par end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last. Yet the
\par current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time
\par away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three
\par months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more
\par wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,
\par that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the
\par violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
\par under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the
\par terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at
\par that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable
\par in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and
\par victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the
\par appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all
\par other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if
\par he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were
\par a Spirit moving among mortals.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par V. The Wood-Sawyer
\par 
\par 
\par One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never
\par sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her
\par husband's head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the
\par tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright
\par women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and
\par old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all
\par daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons,
\par and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.
\par Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to
\par bestow, O Guillotine!
\par 
\par If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,
\par had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle
\par despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from
\par the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in
\par the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was
\par truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good
\par will always be.
\par 
\par As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father
\par had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little
\par household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had
\par its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught,
\par as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The
\par slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief
\par that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy
\par return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the
\par solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many
\par unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only
\par outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.
\par 
\par She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to
\par mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well
\par attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour,
\par and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,
\par thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at
\par night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had
\par repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,
\par was on him. He always resolutely answered: "Nothing can happen to him
\par without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie."
\par 
\par They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her
\par father said to her, on coming home one evening:
\par 
\par "My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can
\par sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to
\par it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you
\par in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
\par show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even
\par if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition."
\par 
\par "O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day."
\par 
\par From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the
\par clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
\par When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they
\par went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a
\par single day.
\par 
\par It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel
\par of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
\par end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed
\par her.
\par 
\par "Good day, citizeness."
\par 
\par "Good day, citizen."
\par 
\par This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been
\par established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
\par but, was now law for everybody.
\par 
\par "Walking here again, citizeness?"
\par 
\par "You see me, citizen!"
\par 
\par The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he
\par had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed
\par at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
\par bars, peeped through them jocosely.
\par 
\par "But it's not my business," said he. And went on sawing his wood.
\par 
\par Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she
\par appeared.
\par 
\par "What? Walking here again, citizeness?"
\par 
\par "Yes, citizen."
\par 
\par "Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?"
\par 
\par "Do I say yes, mamma?" whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.
\par 
\par "Yes, dearest."
\par 
\par "Yes, citizen."
\par 
\par "Ah! But it's not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I
\par call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head
\par comes!"
\par 
\par The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.
\par 
\par "I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!
\par Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, a child.
\par Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the
\par family!"
\par 
\par Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was
\par impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in
\par his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him
\par first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.
\par 
\par He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
\par him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart
\par up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her,
\par with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. "But it's
\par not my business!" he would generally say at those times, and would
\par briskly fall to his sawing again.
\par 
\par In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of
\par spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again
\par in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at
\par this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
\par Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in
\par five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
\par for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did
\par see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have
\par waited out the day, seven days a week.
\par 
\par These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her
\par father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing
\par afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild
\par rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along,
\par decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;
\par also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription
\par (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible.
\par Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!
\par 
\par The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
\par surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got
\par somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in
\par with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike
\par and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his
\par saw inscribed as his "Little Sainte Guillotine"--for the great sharp
\par female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he
\par was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.
\par 
\par But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
\par and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment
\par afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
\par prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with
\par The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and
\par they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music
\par than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,
\par keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.
\par Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced
\par together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a
\par mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they
\par filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
\par apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They
\par advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one
\par another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
\par in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest
\par linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
\par and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
\par all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then
\par reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped
\par again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
\par of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
\par up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible
\par as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once
\par innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into
\par a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
\par heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
\par warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly
\par bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the
\par delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
\par the disjointed time.
\par 
\par This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
\par bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow
\par fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.
\par 
\par "O my father!" for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she
\par had momentarily darkened with her hand; "such a cruel, bad sight."
\par 
\par "I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don't be
\par frightened! Not one of them would harm you."
\par 
\par "I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my
\par husband, and the mercies of these people--"
\par 
\par "We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to
\par the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may
\par kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof."
\par 
\par "I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!"
\par 
\par "You cannot see him, my poor dear?"
\par 
\par "No, father," said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand,
\par "no."
\par 
\par A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. "I salute you, citizeness,"
\par from the Doctor. "I salute you, citizen." This in passing. Nothing more.
\par Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.
\par 
\par "Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
\par and courage, for his sake. That was well done;" they had left the spot;
\par "it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow."
\par 
\par "For to-morrow!"
\par 
\par "There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions
\par to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
\par before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know
\par that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the
\par Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?"
\par 
\par She could scarcely answer, "I trust in you."
\par 
\par "Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall
\par be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every
\par protection. I must see Lorry."
\par 
\par He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They
\par both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring
\par away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.
\par 
\par "I must see Lorry," the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.
\par 
\par The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He
\par and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
\par and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No
\par better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to
\par hold his peace.
\par 
\par A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted
\par the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the
\par Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and
\par deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters:
\par National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,
\par Fraternity, or Death!
\par 
\par Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the
\par chair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out,
\par agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did
\par he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and
\par turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued,
\par he said: "Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par VI. Triumph
\par 
\par 
\par The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
\par Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were
\par read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The
\par standard gaoler-joke was, "Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you
\par inside there!"
\par 
\par "Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!"
\par 
\par So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.
\par 
\par When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
\par for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles
\par Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen
\par hundreds pass away so.
\par 
\par His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them
\par to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the
\par list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three
\par names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so
\par summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been
\par guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber
\par where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
\par arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human
\par creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
\par scaffold.
\par 
\par There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was
\par soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force
\par were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
\par concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears
\par there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
\par refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the
\par common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
\par who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from
\par insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
\par time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour
\par or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to
\par brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere
\par boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In
\par seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the
\par disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have
\par like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
\par them.
\par 
\par The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its
\par vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were
\par put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called. All the fifteen
\par were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.
\par 
\par "Charles Evremonde, called Darnay," was at length arraigned.
\par 
\par His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap
\par and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking
\par at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the
\par usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the
\par honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never
\par without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing
\par spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
\par anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,
\par the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore
\par knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many
\par knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under
\par her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom
\par he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly
\par remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in
\par his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed
\par in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to
\par himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to
\par be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
\par the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,
\par in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.
\par Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
\par wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
\par Carmagnole.
\par 
\par Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor
\par as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree
\par which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the
\par decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was
\par the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.
\par 
\par "Take off his head!" cried the audience. "An enemy to the Republic!"
\par 
\par The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the
\par prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
\par England?
\par 
\par Undoubtedly it was.
\par 
\par Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?
\par 
\par Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.
\par 
\par Why not? the President desired to know.
\par 
\par Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
\par to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left
\par his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
\par acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
\par England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.
\par 
\par What proof had he of this?
\par 
\par He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
\par Alexandre Manette.
\par 
\par But he had married in England? the President reminded him.
\par 
\par True, but not an English woman.
\par 
\par A citizeness of France?
\par 
\par Yes. By birth.
\par 
\par Her name and family?
\par 
\par "Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who
\par sits there."
\par 
\par This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation
\par of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were
\par the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
\par countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
\par if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.
\par 
\par On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot
\par according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. The same cautious
\par counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every
\par inch of his road.
\par 
\par The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not
\par sooner?
\par 
\par He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means
\par of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,
\par he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
\par He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of
\par a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his
\par absence. He had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his
\par testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal
\par in the eyes of the Republic?
\par 
\par The populace cried enthusiastically, "No!" and the President rang his
\par bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry "No!"
\par until they left off, of their own will.
\par 
\par The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained
\par that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence
\par to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,
\par but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
\par the President.
\par 
\par The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that
\par it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
\par and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen
\par Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
\par pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of
\par enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
\par overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
\par of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he
\par had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's
\par declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
\par answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde,
\par called Darnay.
\par 
\par Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,
\par and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he
\par proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his
\par release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in
\par England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
\par their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat
\par government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as
\par the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these
\par circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the
\par straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the
\par populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur
\par Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,
\par had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his
\par account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that
\par they were ready with their votes if the President were content to
\par receive them.
\par 
\par At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace
\par set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner's
\par favour, and the President declared him free.
\par 
\par Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
\par sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
\par generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
\par their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of
\par these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
\par to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner
\par was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
\par at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
\par prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after
\par his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
\par exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same
\par people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with
\par the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
\par streets.
\par 
\par His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,
\par rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried
\par together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not
\par assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate
\par itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to
\par him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four
\par hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign
\par of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, "Long live the
\par Republic!"
\par 
\par The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
\par for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great
\par crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
\par Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the
\par concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by
\par turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
\par which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the
\par shore.
\par 
\par They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had
\par taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.
\par Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they
\par had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not
\par even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
\par on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,
\par and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that
\par he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he
\par was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.
\par 
\par In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing
\par him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the
\par prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as
\par they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried
\par him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father
\par had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his
\par feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.
\par 
\par As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
\par face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come
\par together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the
\par rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.
\par Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
\par crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
\par overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank,
\par and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
\par them away.
\par 
\par After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud
\par before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
\par breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;
\par after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
\par his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who
\par lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their
\par rooms.
\par 
\par "Lucie! My own! I am safe."
\par 
\par "O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
\par prayed to Him."
\par 
\par They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in
\par his arms, he said to her:
\par 
\par "And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France
\par could have done what he has done for me."
\par 
\par She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor
\par head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he
\par had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his
\par strength. "You must not be weak, my darling," he remonstrated; "don't
\par tremble so. I have saved him."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par VII. A Knock at the Door
\par 
\par 
\par "I have saved him." It was not another of the dreams in which he had
\par often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a
\par vague but heavy fear was upon her.
\par 
\par All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately
\par revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on
\par vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
\par many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
\par her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her
\par heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.
\par The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
\par the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued
\par them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to
\par his real presence and trembled more.
\par 
\par Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this
\par woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,
\par no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task
\par he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let
\par them all lean upon him.
\par 
\par Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was
\par the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but
\par because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,
\par had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards
\par the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and
\par partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and
\par citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them
\par occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by
\par Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every
\par night.
\par 
\par It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
\par Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every
\par house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
\par of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.
\par Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
\par below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
\par himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had
\par employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called
\par Darnay.
\par 
\par In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
\par harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor's little household, as
\par in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
\par were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
\par shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
\par possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.
\par 
\par For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the
\par office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
\par basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
\par lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
\par such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long
\par association with a French family, might have known as much of their
\par language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
\par direction; consequently she knew no more of that "nonsense" (as she was
\par pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing
\par was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
\par introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be
\par the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold
\par of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always
\par made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
\par one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.
\par 
\par "Now, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;
\par "if you are ready, I am."
\par 
\par Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. He had worn
\par all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.
\par 
\par "There's all manner of things wanted," said Miss Pross, "and we shall
\par have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts
\par these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it."
\par 
\par "It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,"
\par retorted Jerry, "whether they drink your health or the Old Un's."
\par 
\par "Who's he?" said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning "Old
\par Nick's."
\par 
\par "Ha!" said Miss Pross, "it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the
\par meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder,
\par and Mischief."
\par 
\par "Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!" cried Lucie.
\par 
\par "Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious," said Miss Pross; "but I may say
\par among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
\par smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the
\par streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!
\par Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your
\par pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
\par May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?"
\par 
\par "I think you may take that liberty," the Doctor answered, smiling.
\par 
\par "For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of
\par that," said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par "Hush, dear! Again?" Lucie remonstrated.
\par 
\par "Well, my sweet," said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, "the
\par short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious
\par Majesty King George the Third;" Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; "and
\par as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish
\par tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!"
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
\par after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.
\par 
\par "I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you
\par had never taken that cold in your voice," said Miss Pross, approvingly.
\par "But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there"--it was the good creature's
\par way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
\par with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--"is there any
\par prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?"
\par 
\par "I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet."
\par 
\par "Heigh-ho-hum!" said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
\par glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, "then we
\par must have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and
\par fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don't
\par you move, Ladybird!"
\par 
\par They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the
\par child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
\par Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in
\par a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie
\par sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,
\par in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of
\par a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
\par a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and
\par quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.
\par 
\par "What is that?" she cried, all at once.
\par 
\par "My dear!" said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand
\par on hers, "command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The
\par least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father's daughter!"
\par 
\par "I thought, my father," said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
\par and in a faltering voice, "that I heard strange feet upon the stairs."
\par 
\par "My love, the staircase is as still as Death."
\par 
\par As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.
\par 
\par "Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!"
\par 
\par "My child," said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her
\par shoulder, "I _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go
\par to the door."
\par 
\par He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,
\par and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough
\par men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.
\par 
\par "The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay," said the first.
\par 
\par "Who seeks him?" answered Darnay.
\par 
\par "I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the
\par Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic."
\par 
\par The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging
\par to him.
\par 
\par "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?"
\par 
\par "It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
\par know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow."
\par 
\par Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he
\par stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it,
\par moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting
\par the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red
\par woollen shirt, said:
\par 
\par "You know him, you have said. Do you know me?"
\par 
\par "Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor."
\par 
\par "We all know you, Citizen Doctor," said the other three.
\par 
\par He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,
\par after a pause:
\par 
\par "Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?"
\par 
\par "Citizen Doctor," said the first, reluctantly, "he has been denounced to
\par the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen," pointing out the second who
\par had entered, "is from Saint Antoine."
\par 
\par The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:
\par 
\par "He is accused by Saint Antoine."
\par 
\par "Of what?" asked the Doctor.
\par 
\par "Citizen Doctor," said the first, with his former reluctance, "ask no
\par more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as
\par a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all.
\par The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed."
\par 
\par "One word," the Doctor entreated. "Will you tell me who denounced him?"
\par 
\par "It is against rule," answered the first; "but you can ask Him of Saint
\par Antoine here."
\par 
\par The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his
\par feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:
\par 
\par "Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by
\par the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other."
\par 
\par "What other?"
\par 
\par "Do _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par "Then," said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, "you will be
\par answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par VIII. A Hand at Cards
\par 
\par 
\par Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her
\par way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
\par Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
\par she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They
\par both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
\par passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
\par turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It
\par was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing
\par lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
\par stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the
\par Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got
\par undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never
\par grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.
\par 
\par Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil
\par for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
\par After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the
\par Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
\par once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather
\par took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same
\par description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was
\par not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her
\par opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,
\par attended by her cavalier.
\par 
\par Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
\par playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,
\par bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of
\par the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be
\par resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the
\par popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,
\par like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached
\par the counter, and showed what they wanted.
\par 
\par As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a
\par corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No
\par sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped
\par her hands.
\par 
\par In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was
\par assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
\par likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only
\par saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all
\par the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,
\par evidently English.
\par 
\par What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the
\par Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very
\par voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss
\par Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no
\par ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that
\par not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
\par Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual
\par account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.
\par 
\par "What is the matter?" said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;
\par speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in
\par English.
\par 
\par "Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!" cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.
\par "After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,
\par do I find you here!"
\par 
\par "Don't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?" asked the
\par man, in a furtive, frightened way.
\par 
\par "Brother, brother!" cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. "Have I ever
\par been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?"
\par 
\par "Then hold your meddlesome tongue," said Solomon, "and come out, if you
\par want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who's this man?"
\par 
\par Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
\par affectionate brother, said through her tears, "Mr. Cruncher."
\par 
\par "Let him come out too," said Solomon. "Does he think me a ghost?"
\par 
\par Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a
\par word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
\par through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did
\par so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus
\par of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French
\par language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
\par pursuits.
\par 
\par "Now," said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, "what do you
\par want?"
\par 
\par "How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
\par from!" cried Miss Pross, "to give me such a greeting, and show me no
\par affection."
\par 
\par "There. Confound it! There," said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's
\par lips with his own. "Now are you content?"
\par 
\par Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.
\par 
\par "If you expect me to be surprised," said her brother Solomon, "I am not
\par surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If
\par you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you
\par do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I
\par am an official."
\par 
\par "My English brother Solomon," mourned Miss Pross, casting up her
\par tear-fraught eyes, "that had the makings in him of one of the best and
\par greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and
\par such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
\par his--"
\par 
\par "I said so!" cried her brother, interrupting. "I knew it. You want to be
\par the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just
\par as I am getting on!"
\par 
\par "The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!" cried Miss Pross. "Far
\par rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
\par loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,
\par and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
\par detain you no longer."
\par 
\par Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any
\par culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years
\par ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent
\par her money and left her!
\par 
\par He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging
\par condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
\par merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,
\par all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,
\par hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
\par question:
\par 
\par "I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,
\par or Solomon John?"
\par 
\par The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not
\par previously uttered a word.
\par 
\par "Come!" said Mr. Cruncher. "Speak out, you know." (Which, by the way,
\par was more than he could do himself.) "John Solomon, or Solomon John? She
\par calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know
\par you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that
\par name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water."
\par 
\par "What do you mean?"
\par 
\par "Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name
\par was, over the water."
\par 
\par "No?"
\par 
\par "No. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables."
\par 
\par "Indeed?"
\par 
\par "Yes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness
\par at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to
\par yourself, was you called at that time?"
\par 
\par "Barsad," said another voice, striking in.
\par 
\par "That's the name for a thousand pound!" cried Jerry.
\par 
\par The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind
\par him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's
\par elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.
\par 
\par "Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his
\par surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself
\par elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
\par myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a
\par better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad
\par was not a Sheep of the Prisons."
\par 
\par Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,
\par who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--
\par 
\par "I'll tell you," said Sydney. "I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out
\par of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,
\par an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember
\par faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having
\par a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with
\par the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
\par direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and
\par sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
\par conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the
\par nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed
\par to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad."
\par 
\par "What purpose?" the spy asked.
\par 
\par "It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the
\par street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your
\par company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?"
\par 
\par "Under a threat?"
\par 
\par "Oh! Did I say that?"
\par 
\par "Then, why should I go there?"
\par 
\par "Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't."
\par 
\par "Do you mean that you won't say, sir?" the spy irresolutely asked.
\par 
\par "You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won't."
\par 
\par Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
\par quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,
\par and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and
\par made the most of it.
\par 
\par "Now, I told you so," said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his
\par sister; "if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing."
\par 
\par "Come, come, Mr. Barsad!" exclaimed Sydney. "Don't be ungrateful.
\par But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so
\par pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
\par satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?"
\par 
\par "I'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you."
\par 
\par "I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her
\par own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,
\par at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
\par knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us. Are we
\par ready? Come then!"
\par 
\par Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life
\par remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up
\par in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced
\par purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only
\par contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was
\par too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
\par her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to
\par heed what she observed.
\par 
\par They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.
\par Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon
\par Pross, walked at his side.
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
\par little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the
\par picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked
\par into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years
\par ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
\par which he saw a stranger.
\par 
\par "Miss Pross's brother, sir," said Sydney. "Mr. Barsad."
\par 
\par "Barsad?" repeated the old gentleman, "Barsad? I have an association
\par with the name--and with the face."
\par 
\par "I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad," observed Carton,
\par coolly. "Pray sit down."
\par 
\par As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,
\par by saying to him with a frown, "Witness at that trial." Mr. Lorry
\par immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
\par look of abhorrence.
\par 
\par "Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate
\par brother you have heard of," said Sydney, "and has acknowledged the
\par relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again."
\par 
\par Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, "What do you
\par tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about
\par to return to him!"
\par 
\par "Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?"
\par 
\par "Just now, if at all."
\par 
\par "Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir," said Sydney, "and I
\par have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep
\par over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the
\par messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no
\par earthly doubt that he is retaken."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss
\par of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something
\par might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
\par silently attentive.
\par 
\par "Now, I trust," said Sydney to him, "that the name and influence of
\par Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he
\par would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--"
\par 
\par "Yes; I believe so."
\par 
\par "--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own
\par to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the
\par power to prevent this arrest."
\par 
\par "He may not have known of it beforehand," said Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how
\par identified he is with his son-in-law."
\par 
\par "That's true," Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his
\par chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.
\par 
\par "In short," said Sydney, "this is a desperate time, when desperate games
\par are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I
\par will play the losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one
\par carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the
\par stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend
\par in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.
\par Barsad."
\par 
\par "You need have good cards, sir," said the spy.
\par 
\par "I'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a
\par brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy."
\par 
\par It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another
\par glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.
\par 
\par "Mr. Barsad," he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking
\par over a hand at cards: "Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
\par committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
\par so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman
\par is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
\par Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.
\par That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
\par French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
\par English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent
\par card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.
\par Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the
\par spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,
\par the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
\par difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my
\par hand, Mr. Barsad?"
\par 
\par "Not to understand your play," returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.
\par 
\par "I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section
\par Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't
\par hurry."
\par 
\par He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
\par drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
\par into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he
\par poured out and drank another glassful.
\par 
\par "Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time."
\par 
\par It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards
\par in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable
\par employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
\par there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for
\par vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
\par date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in
\par France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
\par there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He
\par knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint
\par Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police
\par such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment,
\par release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to
\par familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame
\par Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered
\par with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he
\par talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.
\par He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over
\par again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the
\par guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as
\par he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that
\par he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of
\par his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
\par terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such
\par grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw
\par that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
\par proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash
\par his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon
\par terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify
\par the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.
\par 
\par "You scarcely seem to like your hand," said Sydney, with the greatest
\par composure. "Do you play?"
\par 
\par "I think, sir," said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.
\par Lorry, "I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to
\par put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can
\par under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace
\par of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is
\par considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by
\par somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean
\par himself as to make himself one?"
\par 
\par "I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad," said Carton, taking the answer on himself,
\par and looking at his watch, "without any scruple, in a very few minutes."
\par 
\par "I should have hoped, gentlemen both," said the spy, always striving to
\par hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, "that your respect for my sister--"
\par 
\par "I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
\par relieving her of her brother," said Sydney Carton.
\par 
\par "You think not, sir?"
\par 
\par "I have thoroughly made up my mind about it."
\par 
\par The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his
\par ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,
\par received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a
\par mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and
\par failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air
\par of contemplating cards:
\par 
\par "And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I
\par have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and
\par fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
\par who was he?"
\par 
\par "French. You don't know him," said the spy, quickly.
\par 
\par "French, eh?" repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him
\par at all, though he echoed his word. "Well; he may be."
\par 
\par "Is, I assure you," said the spy; "though it's not important."
\par 
\par "Though it's not important," repeated Carton, in the same mechanical
\par way--"though it's not important--No, it's not important. No. Yet I know
\par the face."
\par 
\par "I think not. I am sure not. It can't be," said the spy.
\par 
\par "It-can't-be," muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his
\par glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. "Can't-be. Spoke good
\par French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?"
\par 
\par "Provincial," said the spy.
\par 
\par "No. Foreign!" cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a
\par light broke clearly on his mind. "Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We
\par had that man before us at the Old Bailey."
\par 
\par "Now, there you are hasty, sir," said Barsad, with a smile that gave his
\par aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; "there you really give
\par me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this
\par distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I
\par attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church
\par of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard
\par multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped
\par to lay him in his coffin."
\par 
\par Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable
\par goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it
\par to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
\par risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.
\par 
\par "Let us be reasonable," said the spy, "and let us be fair. To show you
\par how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will
\par lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have
\par carried in my pocket-book," with a hurried hand he produced and opened
\par it, "ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take
\par it in your hand; it's no forgery."
\par 
\par Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
\par Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more
\par violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the
\par crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.
\par 
\par Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on
\par the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.
\par 
\par "That there Roger Cly, master," said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and
\par iron-bound visage. "So _you_ put him in his coffin?"
\par 
\par "I did."
\par 
\par "Who took him out of it?"
\par 
\par Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, "What do you mean?"
\par 
\par "I mean," said Mr. Cruncher, "that he warn't never in it. No! Not he!
\par I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it."
\par 
\par The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
\par unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.
\par 
\par "I tell you," said Jerry, "that you buried paving-stones and earth in
\par that there coffin. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a
\par take in. Me and two more knows it."
\par 
\par "How do you know it?"
\par 
\par "What's that to you? Ecod!" growled Mr. Cruncher, "it's you I have got a
\par old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!
\par I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea."
\par 
\par Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
\par this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
\par explain himself.
\par 
\par "At another time, sir," he returned, evasively, "the present time is
\par ill-conwenient for explainin'. What I stand to, is, that he knows well
\par wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,
\par in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his
\par throat and choke him for half a guinea;" Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as
\par quite a liberal offer; "or I'll out and announce him."
\par 
\par "Humph! I see one thing," said Carton. "I hold another card, Mr. Barsad.
\par Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for
\par you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another
\par aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has
\par the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!
\par A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong
\par card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?"
\par 
\par "No!" returned the spy. "I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular
\par with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk
\par of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that
\par he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this
\par man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me."
\par 
\par "Never you trouble your head about this man," retorted the contentious
\par Mr. Cruncher; "you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
\par that gentleman. And look here! Once more!"--Mr. Cruncher could not
\par be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
\par liberality--"I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
\par guinea."
\par 
\par The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,
\par with more decision, "It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and
\par can't overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
\par Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my
\par office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my
\par life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,
\par I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate
\par here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my
\par way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with
\par me?"
\par 
\par "Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?"
\par 
\par "I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,"
\par said the spy, firmly.
\par 
\par "Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the
\par Conciergerie?"
\par 
\par "I am sometimes."
\par 
\par "You can be when you choose?"
\par 
\par "I can pass in and out when I choose."
\par 
\par Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
\par upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he
\par said, rising:
\par 
\par "So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that
\par the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come
\par into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par IX. The Game Made
\par 
\par 
\par While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining
\par dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked
\par at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's
\par manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the
\par leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,
\par and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very
\par questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught
\par his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
\par hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an
\par infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.
\par 
\par "Jerry," said Mr. Lorry. "Come here."
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance
\par of him.
\par 
\par "What have you been, besides a messenger?"
\par 
\par After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,
\par Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, "Agicultooral
\par character."
\par 
\par "My mind misgives me much," said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger
\par at him, "that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's
\par as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
\par description. If you have, don't expect me to befriend you when you
\par get back to England. If you have, don't expect me to keep your secret.
\par Tellson's shall not be imposed upon."
\par 
\par "I hope, sir," pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, "that a gentleman like
\par yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it,
\par would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it
\par is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if
\par it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side. There'd be two sides
\par to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
\par up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his
\par fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor
\par yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking
\par their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going
\par out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.
\par Well, that 'ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's. For you cannot sarse the
\par goose and not the gander. And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos
\par in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,
\par a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark
\par ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch 'em at
\par it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,
\par and how can you rightly have one without t'other? Then, wot with
\par undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot
\par with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get
\par much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never
\par prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He'd never have no good of it; he'd want
\par all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being
\par once in--even if it wos so."
\par 
\par "Ugh!" cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, "I am shocked at
\par the sight of you."
\par 
\par "Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir," pursued Mr. Cruncher,
\par "even if it wos so, which I don't say it is--"
\par 
\par "Don't prevaricate," said Mr. Lorry.
\par 
\par "No, I will _not_, sir," returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were
\par further from his thoughts or practice--"which I don't say it is--wot I
\par would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at
\par that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to
\par be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till
\par your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it
\par wos so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to
\par you, sir), let that there boy keep his father's place, and take care of
\par his mother; don't blow upon that boy's father--do not do it, sir--and
\par let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends
\par for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin' of 'em in with
\par a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe.
\par That, Mr. Lorry," said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his
\par arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
\par discourse, "is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don't
\par see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects
\par without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
\par to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of
\par things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you
\par fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good
\par cause when I might have kep' it back."
\par 
\par "That at least is true," said Mr. Lorry. "Say no more now. It may be
\par that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
\par action--not in words. I want no more words."
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
\par returned from the dark room. "Adieu, Mr. Barsad," said the former; "our
\par arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me."
\par 
\par He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they
\par were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?
\par 
\par "Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access
\par to him, once."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry's countenance fell.
\par 
\par "It is all I could do," said Carton. "To propose too much, would be
\par to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing
\par worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the
\par weakness of the position. There is no help for it."
\par 
\par "But access to him," said Mr. Lorry, "if it should go ill before the
\par Tribunal, will not save him."
\par 
\par "I never said it would."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his
\par darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually
\par weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,
\par and his tears fell.
\par 
\par "You are a good man and a true friend," said Carton, in an altered
\par voice. "Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my
\par father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your
\par sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
\par however."
\par 
\par Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there
\par was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,
\par that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly
\par unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.
\par 
\par "To return to poor Darnay," said Carton. "Don't tell Her of this
\par interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see
\par him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
\par to him the means of anticipating the sentence."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to
\par see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and
\par evidently understood it.
\par 
\par "She might think a thousand things," Carton said, "and any of them would
\par only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said to you when
\par I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any
\par little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.
\par You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night."
\par 
\par "I am going now, directly."
\par 
\par "I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
\par on you. How does she look?"
\par 
\par "Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful."
\par 
\par "Ah!"
\par 
\par It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It
\par attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the
\par fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),
\par passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
\par wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
\par flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat
\par and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
\par light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,
\par all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was
\par sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
\par his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
\par broken under the weight of his foot.
\par 
\par "I forgot it," he said.
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the
\par wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having
\par the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly
\par reminded of that expression.
\par 
\par "And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?" said Carton, turning
\par to him.
\par 
\par "Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so
\par unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to
\par have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have
\par my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go."
\par 
\par They were both silent.
\par 
\par "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?" said Carton, wistfully.
\par 
\par "I am in my seventy-eighth year."
\par 
\par "You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
\par trusted, respected, and looked up to?"
\par 
\par "I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I
\par may say that I was a man of business when a boy."
\par 
\par "See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss
\par you when you leave it empty!"
\par 
\par "A solitary old bachelor," answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. "There
\par is nobody to weep for me."
\par 
\par "How can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her child?"
\par 
\par "Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said."
\par 
\par "It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?"
\par 
\par "Surely, surely."
\par 
\par "If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,
\par 'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or
\par respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
\par regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!'
\par your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
\par not?"
\par 
\par "You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be."
\par 
\par Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
\par few moments, said:
\par 
\par "I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the
\par days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?"
\par 
\par Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:
\par 
\par "Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
\par closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and
\par nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
\par preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances
\par that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),
\par and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not
\par so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me."
\par 
\par "I understand the feeling!" exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. "And
\par you are the better for it?"
\par 
\par "I hope so."
\par 
\par Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with
\par his outer coat; "But you," said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, "you
\par are young."
\par 
\par "Yes," said Carton. "I am not old, but my young way was never the way to
\par age. Enough of me."
\par 
\par "And of me, I am sure," said Mr. Lorry. "Are you going out?"
\par 
\par "I'll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless
\par habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be
\par uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?"
\par 
\par "Yes, unhappily."
\par 
\par "I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a
\par place for me. Take my arm, sir."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A
\par few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him
\par there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate
\par again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to
\par the prison every day. "She came out here," he said, looking about him,
\par "turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in
\par her steps."
\par 
\par It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,
\par where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having
\par closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.
\par 
\par "Good night, citizen," said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the
\par man eyed him inquisitively.
\par 
\par "Good night, citizen."
\par 
\par "How goes the Republic?"
\par 
\par "You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount
\par to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being
\par exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!"
\par 
\par "Do you often go to see him--"
\par 
\par "Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?"
\par 
\par "Never."
\par 
\par "Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
\par citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less
\par than two pipes. Word of honour!"
\par 
\par As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain
\par how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire
\par to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.
\par 
\par "But you are not English," said the wood-sawyer, "though you wear
\par English dress?"
\par 
\par "Yes," said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.
\par 
\par "You speak like a Frenchman."
\par 
\par "I am an old student here."
\par 
\par "Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman."
\par 
\par "Good night, citizen."
\par 
\par "But go and see that droll dog," the little man persisted, calling after
\par him. "And take a pipe with you!"
\par 
\par Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of
\par the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
\par of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
\par the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,
\par for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
\par terror--he stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with
\par his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill
\par thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.
\par 
\par Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
\par counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. "Whew!" the chemist
\par whistled softly, as he read it. "Hi! hi! hi!"
\par 
\par Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:
\par 
\par "For you, citizen?"
\par 
\par "For me."
\par 
\par "You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the
\par consequences of mixing them?"
\par 
\par "Perfectly."
\par 
\par Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by
\par one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,
\par and deliberately left the shop. "There is nothing more to do," said he,
\par glancing upward at the moon, "until to-morrow. I can't sleep."
\par 
\par It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words
\par aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
\par negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
\par had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
\par his road and saw its end.
\par 
\par Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
\par youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His
\par mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been
\par read at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark
\par streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing
\par on high above him. "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:
\par he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
\par whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."
\par 
\par In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow
\par rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,
\par and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,
\par and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that
\par brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep,
\par might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and
\par went on.
\par 
\par With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
\par going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
\par surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers
\par were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
\par of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and
\par profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon
\par the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets
\par along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
\par material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among
\par the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn
\par interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
\par short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for
\par the lighter streets.
\par 
\par Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
\par suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
\par shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the
\par people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At
\par one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking
\par for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over,
\par and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.
\par 
\par "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
\par in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
\par believeth in me, shall never die."
\par 
\par Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
\par were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm
\par and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he
\par heard them always.
\par 
\par The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
\par water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the
\par picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
\par of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the
\par sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,
\par and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to
\par Death's dominion.
\par 
\par But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden
\par of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.
\par And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light
\par appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river
\par sparkled under it.
\par 
\par The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial
\par friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the
\par houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
\par bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little
\par longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the
\par stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--"Like me."
\par 
\par A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
\par glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track
\par in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
\par for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,
\par ended in the words, "I am the resurrection and the life."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise
\par where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a
\par little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh
\par himself, went out to the place of trial.
\par 
\par The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell
\par away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.
\par Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,
\par sitting beside her father.
\par 
\par When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
\par sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying
\par tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy
\par blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If
\par there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney
\par Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.
\par 
\par Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
\par ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have
\par been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not
\par first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the
\par Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.
\par 
\par Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good
\par republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day
\par after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and
\par his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance
\par gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,
\par cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.
\par Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.
\par 
\par Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
\par No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,
\par murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye
\par in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one
\par another, before bending forward with a strained attention.
\par 
\par Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and
\par retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and
\par Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants,
\par one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished
\par privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,
\par called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.
\par 
\par To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.
\par 
\par The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?
\par 
\par "Openly, President."
\par 
\par "By whom?"
\par 
\par "Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine."
\par 
\par "Good."
\par 
\par "Therese Defarge, his wife."
\par 
\par "Good."
\par 
\par "Alexandre Manette, physician."
\par 
\par A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor
\par Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.
\par 
\par "President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
\par a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My
\par daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who
\par and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband
\par of my child!"
\par 
\par "Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of
\par the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer
\par to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
\par Republic."
\par 
\par Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and
\par with warmth resumed.
\par 
\par "If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
\par herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is
\par to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!"
\par 
\par Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with
\par his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew
\par closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,
\par and restored the usual hand to his mouth.
\par 
\par Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
\par being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of
\par his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release,
\par and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.
\par This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.
\par 
\par "You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?"
\par 
\par "I believe so."
\par 
\par Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: "You were one of the
\par best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day
\par there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when
\par it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!"
\par 
\par It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience,
\par thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The
\par Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, "I defy that bell!"
\par wherein she was likewise much commended.
\par 
\par "Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
\par citizen."
\par 
\par "I knew," said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the
\par bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;
\par "I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell
\par known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He
\par knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower,
\par when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve,
\par when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to
\par the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
\par gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a
\par stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is
\par that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens
\par of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.
\par I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of
\par the President."
\par 
\par "Let it be read."
\par 
\par In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking
\par lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with
\par solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
\par reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge
\par never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there
\par intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as
\par follows.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par X. The Substance of the Shadow
\par 
\par 
\par "I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
\par afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
\par cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write
\par it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it
\par in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a
\par place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I
\par and my sorrows are dust.
\par 
\par "These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with
\par difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed
\par with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope
\par has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have
\par noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I
\par solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right
\par mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the
\par truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they
\par be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.
\par 
\par "One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the
\par twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired
\par part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,
\par at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the
\par School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very
\par fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it
\par might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a
\par voice called to the driver to stop.
\par 
\par "The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,
\par and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage
\par was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
\par door and alight before I came up with it.
\par 
\par "I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
\par conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
\par I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
\par younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,
\par and (as far as I could see) face too.
\par 
\par "'You are Doctor Manette?' said one.
\par 
\par "I am."
\par 
\par "'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young
\par physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two
\par has made a rising reputation in Paris?'
\par 
\par "'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so
\par graciously.'
\par 
\par "'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being
\par so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were
\par probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of
\par overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?'
\par 
\par "The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words
\par were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.
\par They were armed. I was not.
\par 
\par "'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me
\par the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to
\par which I am summoned.'
\par 
\par "The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. 'Doctor,
\par your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
\par our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
\par yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to
\par enter the carriage?'
\par 
\par "I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both
\par entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The
\par carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.
\par 
\par "I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that
\par it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took
\par place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make
\par the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my
\par paper in its hiding-place.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par "The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
\par emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the
\par Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards
\par when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently
\par stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by
\par a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
\par overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in
\par answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck
\par the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.
\par 
\par "There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,
\par for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the
\par other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner
\par with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
\par alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.
\par 
\par "From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found
\par locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had
\par relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was
\par conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
\par ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,
\par lying on a bed.
\par 
\par "The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much
\par past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to
\par her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were
\par all portions of a gentleman's dress. On one of them, which was a fringed
\par scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,
\par and the letter E.
\par 
\par "I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;
\par for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
\par edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was
\par in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve
\par her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the
\par corner caught my sight.
\par 
\par "I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
\par and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and
\par wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the
\par words, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' and then counted up to
\par twelve, and said, 'Hush!' For an instant, and no more, she would pause
\par to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she
\par would repeat the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' and
\par would count up to twelve, and say, 'Hush!' There was no variation in the
\par order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment's
\par pause, in the utterance of these sounds.
\par 
\par "'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted?'
\par 
\par "To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
\par younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It
\par was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night.'
\par 
\par "'She has a husband, a father, and a brother?'
\par 
\par "'A brother.'
\par 
\par "'I do not address her brother?'
\par 
\par "He answered with great contempt, 'No.'
\par 
\par "'She has some recent association with the number twelve?'
\par 
\par "The younger brother impatiently rejoined, 'With twelve o'clock?'
\par 
\par "'See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, 'how
\par useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming
\par to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There
\par are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.'
\par 
\par "The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, 'There is
\par a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on
\par the table.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par "I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my
\par lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
\par poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.
\par 
\par "'Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother.
\par 
\par "'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no
\par more.
\par 
\par "I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
\par efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it
\par after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then
\par sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman
\par in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into
\par a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently
\par furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick
\par old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the
\par sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular
\par succession, with the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' the
\par counting up to twelve, and 'Hush!' The frenzy was so violent, that I had
\par not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to
\par them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement
\par in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much
\par soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
\par figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more
\par regular.
\par 
\par "For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by
\par the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,
\par before the elder said:
\par 
\par "'There is another patient.'
\par 
\par "I was startled, and asked, 'Is it a pressing case?'
\par 
\par "'You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par "The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which
\par was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling
\par to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and
\par there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of
\par the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to
\par pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial
\par and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in
\par this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my
\par captivity, as I saw them all that night.
\par 
\par "On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a
\par handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.
\par He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his
\par breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see
\par where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see
\par that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.
\par 
\par "'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. 'Let me examine it.'
\par 
\par "'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be.'
\par 
\par "It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.
\par The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours
\par before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
\par without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder
\par brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
\par ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all
\par as if he were a fellow-creature.
\par 
\par "'How has this been done, monsieur?' said I.
\par 
\par "'A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him,
\par and has fallen by my brother's sword--like a gentleman.'
\par 
\par "There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
\par answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
\par have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would
\par have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
\par vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
\par the boy, or about his fate.
\par 
\par "The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now
\par slowly moved to me.
\par 
\par "'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are
\par proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but
\par we have a little pride left, sometimes. She--have you seen her, Doctor?'
\par 
\par "The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the
\par distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.
\par 
\par "I said, 'I have seen her.'
\par 
\par "'She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these
\par Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we
\par have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say
\par so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a
\par tenant of his. We were all tenants of his--that man's who stands there.
\par The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.'
\par 
\par "It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
\par to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.
\par 
\par "'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs
\par are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to
\par work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged
\par to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden
\par for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and
\par plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we
\par ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his
\par people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,
\par and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a
\par dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should
\par most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable
\par race die out!'
\par 
\par "I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth
\par like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people
\par somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the
\par dying boy.
\par 
\par "'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time,
\par poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort
\par him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not
\par been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her and admired
\par her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among
\par us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and
\par hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two
\par then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her
\par willing?'
\par 
\par "The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the
\par looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two
\par opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this
\par Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all
\par trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.
\par 
\par "'You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
\par harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and
\par drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their
\par grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep
\par may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
\par night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was
\par not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he
\par could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the
\par bell, and died on her bosom.'
\par 
\par "Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
\par tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as
\par he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his
\par wound.
\par 
\par "'Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his
\par brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his
\par brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if
\par it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion,
\par for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the
\par tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke one of the words
\par that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place
\par beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be
\par _his_ vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed
\par in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? It was
\par somewhere here?'
\par 
\par "The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around
\par him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
\par over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.
\par 
\par "'She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was
\par dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck
\par at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to
\par make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword
\par that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust
\par at me with all his skill for his life.'
\par 
\par "My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of
\par a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman's. In
\par another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's.
\par 
\par "'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?'
\par 
\par "'He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he
\par referred to the brother.
\par 
\par "'He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the
\par man who was here? Turn my face to him.'
\par 
\par "I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. But, invested for the
\par moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging
\par me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.
\par 
\par "'Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and
\par his right hand raised, 'in the days when all these things are to be
\par answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to
\par answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that
\par I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for,
\par I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them
\par separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do
\par it.'
\par 
\par "Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
\par forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the
\par finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him
\par down dead.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par "When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving
\par in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last
\par for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the
\par grave.
\par 
\par "I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of
\par the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing
\par quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
\par of her words. They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother!
\par One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
\par twelve. Hush!'
\par 
\par "This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had
\par come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to
\par falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and
\par by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
\par 
\par "It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
\par fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to
\par compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew
\par her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
\par a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had
\par had of her.
\par 
\par "'Is she dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
\par elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.
\par 
\par "'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die.'
\par 
\par "'What strength there is in these common bodies!' he said, looking down
\par at her with some curiosity.
\par 
\par "'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and
\par despair.'
\par 
\par "He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a
\par chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a
\par subdued voice,
\par 
\par "'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I
\par recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high,
\par and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
\par of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen,
\par and not spoken of.'
\par 
\par "I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.
\par 
\par "'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'
\par 
\par "'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients
\par are always received in confidence.' I was guarded in my answer, for I
\par was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.
\par 
\par "Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
\par pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
\par resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par "I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so
\par fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
\par darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or
\par failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that
\par was ever spoken between me and those brothers.
\par 
\par "She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few
\par syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She
\par asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It
\par was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her
\par head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.
\par 
\par "I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the
\par brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until
\par then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
\par woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
\par the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to
\par that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as
\par if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.
\par 
\par "I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
\par brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that
\par peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
\par of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
\par to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger
\par brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,
\par for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more polite to
\par me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance
\par in the mind of the elder, too.
\par 
\par "My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch,
\par answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was alone
\par with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and
\par all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.
\par 
\par "The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride
\par away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with
\par their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.
\par 
\par "'At last she is dead?' said the elder, when I went in.
\par 
\par "'She is dead,' said I.
\par 
\par "'I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned round.
\par 
\par "He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now
\par gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on
\par the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
\par nothing.
\par 
\par "'Pray excuse me,' said I. 'Under the circumstances, no.'
\par 
\par "They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to
\par them, and we parted without another word on either side.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par "I am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. I cannot read what I
\par have written with this gaunt hand.
\par 
\par "Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
\par little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously
\par considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately
\par to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
\par summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the
\par circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities
\par of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be
\par heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a
\par profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state
\par in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but
\par I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
\par compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.
\par 
\par "I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that
\par night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it.
\par It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just
\par completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par "I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is
\par so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so
\par dreadful.
\par 
\par "The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long
\par life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the
\par wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the
\par boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered
\par on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I
\par had seen that nobleman very lately.
\par 
\par "My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
\par conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I
\par know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and
\par in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's
\par share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl
\par was dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her,
\par in secret, a woman's sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of
\par Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.
\par 
\par "She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and
\par her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing
\par but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her
\par inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope
\par that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this
\par wretched hour I am ignorant of both.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par "These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning,
\par yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.
\par 
\par "She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How
\par could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence
\par was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her
\par husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a
\par pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.
\par 
\par "'For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, 'I would do
\par all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his
\par inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent
\par atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What
\par I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few
\par jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the
\par compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if
\par the sister can be discovered.'
\par 
\par "She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, 'It is for thine own dear
\par sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' The child answered her
\par bravely, 'Yes!' I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and
\par went away caressing him. I never saw her more.
\par 
\par "As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew it,
\par I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not
\par trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.
\par 
\par "That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in
\par a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed
\par my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came
\par into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!
\par My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at
\par the gate, standing silent behind him.
\par 
\par "An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me,
\par he had a coach in waiting.
\par 
\par "It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the
\par house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and
\par my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark
\par corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from
\par his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light
\par of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.
\par Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living
\par grave.
\par 
\par "If it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the
\par brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of
\par my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
\par dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But,
\par now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that
\par they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the
\par last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last
\par night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times
\par when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven
\par and to earth."
\par 
\par A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A
\par sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
\par blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,
\par and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.
\par 
\par Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
\par how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured
\par Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their
\par time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been
\par anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.
\par The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
\par sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.
\par 
\par And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a
\par well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One
\par of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
\par the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and
\par self-immolations on the people's altar. Therefore when the President
\par said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good
\par physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by
\par rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
\par a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
\par orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
\par human sympathy.
\par 
\par "Much influence around him, has that Doctor?" murmured Madame Defarge,
\par smiling to The Vengeance. "Save him now, my Doctor, save him!"
\par 
\par At every juryman's vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and
\par roar.
\par 
\par Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy
\par of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the
\par Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XI. Dusk
\par 
\par 
\par The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
\par the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no
\par sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was
\par she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
\par it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.
\par 
\par The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors,
\par the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court's
\par emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood
\par stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face
\par but love and consolation.
\par 
\par "If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if
\par you would have so much compassion for us!"
\par 
\par There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had
\par taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the
\par show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, "Let her embrace
\par him then; it is but a moment." It was silently acquiesced in, and they
\par passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by
\par leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.
\par 
\par "Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We
\par shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!"
\par 
\par They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom.
\par 
\par "I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don't suffer
\par for me. A parting blessing for our child."
\par 
\par "I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by
\par you."
\par 
\par "My husband. No! A moment!" He was tearing himself apart from her.
\par "We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart
\par by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God
\par will raise up friends for her, as He did for me."
\par 
\par Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both
\par of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:
\par 
\par "No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel
\par to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what
\par you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We
\par know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for
\par her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and
\par duty. Heaven be with you!"
\par 
\par Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair,
\par and wring them with a shriek of anguish.
\par 
\par "It could not be otherwise," said the prisoner. "All things have worked
\par together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to
\par discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence
\par near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in
\par nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven
\par bless you!"
\par 
\par As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him
\par with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
\par with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting
\par smile. As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned, laid her head
\par lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his
\par feet.
\par 
\par Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,
\par Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were
\par with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.
\par Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a
\par flush of pride in it.
\par 
\par "Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight."
\par 
\par He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a
\par coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat
\par beside the driver.
\par 
\par When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
\par many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
\par the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up
\par the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where
\par her child and Miss Pross wept over her.
\par 
\par "Don't recall her to herself," he said, softly, to the latter, "she is
\par better so. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints."
\par 
\par "Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!" cried little Lucie, springing up and
\par throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. "Now that
\par you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to
\par save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who
\par love her, bear to see her so?"
\par 
\par He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He
\par put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.
\par 
\par "Before I go," he said, and paused--"I may kiss her?"
\par 
\par It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face
\par with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to
\par him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a
\par handsome old lady, that she heard him say, "A life you love."
\par 
\par When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry
\par and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:
\par 
\par "You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least
\par be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to
\par you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?"
\par 
\par "Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
\par strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did." He returned the
\par answer in great trouble, and very slowly.
\par 
\par "Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few
\par and short, but try."
\par 
\par "I intend to try. I will not rest a moment."
\par 
\par "That's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before
\par now--though never," he added, with a smile and a sigh together, "such
\par great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse
\par it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it
\par were not."
\par 
\par "I will go," said Doctor Manette, "to the Prosecutor and the President
\par straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will
\par write too, and--But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no
\par one will be accessible until dark."
\par 
\par "That's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the
\par forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you
\par speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen
\par these dread powers, Doctor Manette?"
\par 
\par "Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from
\par this."
\par 
\par "It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I
\par go to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from
\par our friend or from yourself?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par "May you prosper!"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the
\par shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.
\par 
\par "I have no hope," said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.
\par 
\par "Nor have I."
\par 
\par "If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare
\par him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man's
\par to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
\par court."
\par 
\par "And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound."
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.
\par 
\par "Don't despond," said Carton, very gently; "don't grieve. I encouraged
\par Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be
\par consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly
\par thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her."
\par 
\par "Yes, yes, yes," returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, "you are right.
\par But he will perish; there is no real hope."
\par 
\par "Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope," echoed Carton.
\par 
\par And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XII. Darkness
\par 
\par 
\par Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. "At
\par Tellson's banking-house at nine," he said, with a musing face. "Shall I
\par do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that
\par these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound
\par precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!
\par Let me think it out!"
\par 
\par Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a
\par turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought
\par in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was
\par confirmed. "It is best," he said, finally resolved, "that these people
\par should know there is such a man as I here." And he turned his face
\par towards Saint Antoine.
\par 
\par Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in
\par the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city
\par well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained
\par its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined
\par at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the
\par first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he
\par had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had
\par dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had
\par done with it.
\par 
\par It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out
\par into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he
\par stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered
\par the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and
\par his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.
\par 
\par There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the
\par restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon
\par the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the
\par Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like
\par a regular member of the establishment.
\par 
\par As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
\par French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
\par glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
\par to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.
\par 
\par He repeated what he had already said.
\par 
\par "English?" asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
\par eyebrows.
\par 
\par After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were
\par slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign
\par accent. "Yes, madame, yes. I am English!"
\par 
\par Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he
\par took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
\par meaning, he heard her say, "I swear to you, like Evremonde!"
\par 
\par Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.
\par 
\par "How?"
\par 
\par "Good evening."
\par 
\par "Oh! Good evening, citizen," filling his glass. "Ah! and good wine. I
\par drink to the Republic."
\par 
\par Defarge went back to the counter, and said, "Certainly, a little like."
\par Madame sternly retorted, "I tell you a good deal like." Jacques Three
\par pacifically remarked, "He is so much in your mind, see you, madame."
\par The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, "Yes, my faith! And you
\par are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
\par to-morrow!"
\par 
\par Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow
\par forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning
\par their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence
\par of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without
\par disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed
\par their conversation.
\par 
\par "It is true what madame says," observed Jacques Three. "Why stop? There
\par is great force in that. Why stop?"
\par 
\par "Well, well," reasoned Defarge, "but one must stop somewhere. After all,
\par the question is still where?"
\par 
\par "At extermination," said madame.
\par 
\par "Magnificent!" croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly
\par approved.
\par 
\par "Extermination is good doctrine, my wife," said Defarge, rather
\par troubled; "in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has
\par suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when
\par the paper was read."
\par 
\par "I have observed his face!" repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.
\par "Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the
\par face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!"
\par 
\par "And you have observed, my wife," said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,
\par "the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!"
\par 
\par "I have observed his daughter," repeated madame; "yes, I have observed
\par his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I
\par have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and
\par I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my
\par finger--!" She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were always on
\par his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as
\par if the axe had dropped.
\par 
\par "The citizeness is superb!" croaked the Juryman.
\par 
\par "She is an Angel!" said The Vengeance, and embraced her.
\par 
\par "As to thee," pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, "if it
\par depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this
\par man even now."
\par 
\par "No!" protested Defarge. "Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I
\par would leave the matter there. I say, stop there."
\par 
\par "See you then, Jacques," said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; "and see you,
\par too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as
\par tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,
\par doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so."
\par 
\par "It is so," assented Defarge, without being asked.
\par 
\par "In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds
\par this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the
\par night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,
\par by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so."
\par 
\par "It is so," assented Defarge.
\par 
\par "That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is
\par burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
\par those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is
\par that so."
\par 
\par "It is so," assented Defarge again.
\par 
\par "I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two
\par hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, 'Defarge, I was brought up
\par among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured
\par by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my
\par family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
\par was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child
\par was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,
\par those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things
\par descends to me!' Ask him, is that so."
\par 
\par "It is so," assented Defarge once more.
\par 
\par "Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop," returned madame; "but don't
\par tell me."
\par 
\par Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
\par of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing
\par her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed
\par a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but
\par only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. "Tell
\par the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!"
\par 
\par Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer
\par paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as
\par a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge
\par took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.
\par The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might
\par be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and
\par deep.
\par 
\par But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
\par prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present
\par himself in Mr. Lorry's room again, where he found the old gentleman
\par walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie
\par until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and
\par keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the
\par banking-house towards four o'clock. She had some faint hopes that his
\par mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been
\par more than five hours gone: where could he be?
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
\par he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he
\par should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
\par In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.
\par 
\par He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette
\par did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and
\par brought none. Where could he be?
\par 
\par They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some
\par weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on
\par the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was
\par lost.
\par 
\par Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that
\par time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at
\par them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.
\par 
\par "I cannot find it," said he, "and I must have it. Where is it?"
\par 
\par His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look
\par straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.
\par 
\par "Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I
\par can't find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must
\par finish those shoes."
\par 
\par They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.
\par 
\par "Come, come!" said he, in a whimpering miserable way; "let me get to
\par work. Give me my work."
\par 
\par Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the
\par ground, like a distracted child.
\par 
\par "Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch," he implored them, with a dreadful
\par cry; "but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are
\par not done to-night?"
\par 
\par Lost, utterly lost!
\par 
\par It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,
\par that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and
\par soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should
\par have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the
\par embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret
\par time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into
\par the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.
\par 
\par Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle
\par of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely
\par daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both
\par too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with
\par one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:
\par 
\par "The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken
\par to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to
\par me? Don't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and
\par exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one."
\par 
\par "I do not doubt it," answered Mr. Lorry. "Say on."
\par 
\par The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously
\par rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as
\par they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the
\par night.
\par 
\par Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his
\par feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to
\par carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton
\par took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. "We should look
\par at this!" he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and
\par exclaimed, "Thank _God!_"
\par 
\par "What is it?" asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.
\par 
\par "A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First," he put his hand in
\par his coat, and took another paper from it, "that is the certificate which
\par enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,
\par an Englishman?"
\par 
\par Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.
\par 
\par "Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you
\par remember, and I had better not take it into the prison."
\par 
\par "Why not?"
\par 
\par "I don't know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor
\par Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him
\par and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the
\par frontier! You see?"
\par 
\par "Yes!"
\par 
\par "Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,
\par yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don't stay to look; put it
\par up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until
\par within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is
\par good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to
\par think, will be."
\par 
\par "They are not in danger?"
\par 
\par "They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame
\par Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that
\par woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong
\par colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He
\par confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,
\par is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by
\par Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her"--he never mentioned Lucie's
\par name--"making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that
\par the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will
\par involve her life--and perhaps her child's--and perhaps her father's--for
\par both have been seen with her at that place. Don't look so horrified. You
\par will save them all."
\par 
\par "Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?"
\par 
\par "I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend
\par on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place
\par until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;
\par more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to
\par mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her
\par father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the
\par inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that
\par strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?"
\par 
\par "So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for
\par the moment I lose sight," touching the back of the Doctor's chair, "even
\par of this distress."
\par 
\par "You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
\par as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been
\par completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your
\par horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the
\par afternoon."
\par 
\par "It shall be done!"
\par 
\par His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the
\par flame, and was as quick as youth.
\par 
\par "You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man?
\par Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child
\par and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head
\par beside her husband's cheerfully." He faltered for an instant; then went
\par on as before. "For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her
\par the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell
\par her that it was her husband's last arrangement. Tell her that more
\par depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her
\par father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?"
\par 
\par "I am sure of it."
\par 
\par "I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in
\par the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.
\par The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away."
\par 
\par "I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?"
\par 
\par "You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will
\par reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and
\par then for England!"
\par 
\par "Why, then," said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady
\par hand, "it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young
\par and ardent man at my side."
\par 
\par "By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will
\par influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one
\par another."
\par 
\par "Nothing, Carton."
\par 
\par "Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for
\par any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must
\par inevitably be sacrificed."
\par 
\par "I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully."
\par 
\par "And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!"
\par 
\par Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even
\par put the old man's hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He
\par helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers,
\par as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find
\par where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought
\par to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
\par courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in
\par the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
\par it--outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained
\par there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of
\par her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a
\par Farewell.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XIII. Fifty-two
\par 
\par 
\par In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited
\par their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were
\par to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless
\par everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants
\par were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,
\par the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set
\par apart.
\par 
\par Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy,
\par whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose
\par poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered
\par in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;
\par and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
\par intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally
\par without distinction.
\par 
\par Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no
\par flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line
\par of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had
\par fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,
\par that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
\par avail him nothing.
\par 
\par Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh
\par before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life
\par was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts
\par and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and
\par when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,
\par this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,
\par a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against
\par resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and
\par child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a
\par selfish thing.
\par 
\par But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there
\par was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same
\par road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate
\par him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
\par enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,
\par by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his
\par thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.
\par 
\par Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had
\par travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means
\par of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the
\par prison lamps should be extinguished.
\par 
\par He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing
\par of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,
\par and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's
\par responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had
\par already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
\par he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that
\par her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he
\par had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,
\par for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had
\par become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled
\par to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on
\par that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had
\par preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that
\par he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no
\par mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
\par discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He
\par besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console
\par her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think
\par of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
\par reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
\par sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
\par blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their
\par dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her
\par father.
\par 
\par To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her
\par father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And
\par he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any
\par despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
\par tending.
\par 
\par To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.
\par That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
\par attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so
\par full of the others, that he never once thought of him.
\par 
\par He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When
\par he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.
\par 
\par But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining
\par forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had
\par nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of
\par heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and
\par he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even
\par suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there
\par was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the
\par sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it
\par flashed upon his mind, "this is the day of my death!"
\par 
\par Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads
\par were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could
\par meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking
\par thoughts, which was very difficult to master.
\par 
\par He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How
\par high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be
\par stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed
\par red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,
\par or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
\par directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
\par times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no
\par fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
\par to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
\par few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
\par the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.
\par 
\par The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the
\par numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for
\par ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard
\par contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
\par him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly
\par repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.
\par He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for
\par himself and for them.
\par 
\par Twelve gone for ever.
\par 
\par He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would
\par be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
\par and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two
\par before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
\par interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.
\par 
\par Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very
\par different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force,
\par he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had
\par measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his
\par recovered self-possession, he thought, "There is but another now," and
\par turned to walk again.
\par 
\par Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.
\par 
\par The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or
\par as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: "He has never seen
\par me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose
\par no time!"
\par 
\par The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him
\par face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his
\par features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.
\par 
\par There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the
\par first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
\par imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner's
\par hand, and it was his real grasp.
\par 
\par "Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?" he said.
\par 
\par "I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You
\par are not"--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--"a prisoner?"
\par 
\par "No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
\par here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her--your
\par wife, dear Darnay."
\par 
\par The prisoner wrung his hand.
\par 
\par "I bring you a request from her."
\par 
\par "What is it?"
\par 
\par "A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you
\par in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well
\par remember."
\par 
\par The prisoner turned his face partly aside.
\par 
\par "You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have
\par no time to tell you. You must comply with it--take off those boots you
\par wear, and draw on these of mine."
\par 
\par There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
\par Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got
\par him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.
\par 
\par "Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to
\par them. Quick!"
\par 
\par "Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You
\par will only die with me. It is madness."
\par 
\par "It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you
\par to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change
\par that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do
\par it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like
\par this of mine!"
\par 
\par With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action,
\par that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him.
\par The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.
\par 
\par "Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never
\par can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you
\par not to add your death to the bitterness of mine."
\par 
\par "Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,
\par refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand
\par steady enough to write?"
\par 
\par "It was when you came in."
\par 
\par "Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!"
\par 
\par Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.
\par Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.
\par 
\par "Write exactly as I speak."
\par 
\par "To whom do I address it?"
\par 
\par "To no one." Carton still had his hand in his breast.
\par 
\par "Do I date it?"
\par 
\par "No."
\par 
\par The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with
\par his hand in his breast, looked down.
\par 
\par "'If you remember,'" said Carton, dictating, "'the words that passed
\par between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
\par You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.'"
\par 
\par He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look
\par up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon
\par something.
\par 
\par "Have you written 'forget them'?" Carton asked.
\par 
\par "I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?"
\par 
\par "No; I am not armed."
\par 
\par "What is it in your hand?"
\par 
\par "You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more." He
\par dictated again. "'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove
\par them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.'" As he said these
\par words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly
\par moved down close to the writer's face.
\par 
\par The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about
\par him vacantly.
\par 
\par "What vapour is that?" he asked.
\par 
\par "Vapour?"
\par 
\par "Something that crossed me?"
\par 
\par "I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen
\par and finish. Hurry, hurry!"
\par 
\par As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the
\par prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton
\par with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his
\par hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.
\par 
\par "Hurry, hurry!"
\par 
\par The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.
\par 
\par "'If it had been otherwise;'" Carton's hand was again watchfully and
\par softly stealing down; "'I never should have used the longer opportunity.
\par If it had been otherwise;'" the hand was at the prisoner's face; "'I
\par should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been
\par otherwise--'" Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
\par unintelligible signs.
\par 
\par Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up
\par with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his
\par nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist. For a few
\par seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his
\par life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on
\par the ground.
\par 
\par Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton
\par dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back
\par his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he
\par softly called, "Enter there! Come in!" and the Spy presented himself.
\par 
\par "You see?" said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the
\par insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: "is your hazard very
\par great?"
\par 
\par "Mr. Carton," the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, "my
\par hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to
\par the whole of your bargain."
\par 
\par "Don't fear me. I will be true to the death."
\par 
\par "You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being
\par made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear."
\par 
\par "Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the
\par rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and
\par take me to the coach."
\par 
\par "You?" said the Spy nervously.
\par 
\par "Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which
\par you brought me in?"
\par 
\par "Of course."
\par 
\par "I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you
\par take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has
\par happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands.
\par Quick! Call assistance!"
\par 
\par "You swear not to betray me?" said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a
\par last moment.
\par 
\par "Man, man!" returned Carton, stamping his foot; "have I sworn by no
\par solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious
\par moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place
\par him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him
\par yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of
\par last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!"
\par 
\par The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his
\par forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.
\par 
\par "How, then?" said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. "So
\par afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
\par Sainte Guillotine?"
\par 
\par "A good patriot," said the other, "could hardly have been more afflicted
\par if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank."
\par 
\par They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had
\par brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.
\par 
\par "The time is short, Evremonde," said the Spy, in a warning voice.
\par 
\par "I know it well," answered Carton. "Be careful of my friend, I entreat
\par you, and leave me."
\par 
\par "Come, then, my children," said Barsad. "Lift him, and come away!"
\par 
\par The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of
\par listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote
\par suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,
\par footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry
\par made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he
\par sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.
\par 
\par Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then
\par began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and
\par finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely
\par saying, "Follow me, Evremonde!" and he followed into a large dark room,
\par at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows
\par within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern
\par the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were
\par standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;
\par but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking
\par fixedly at the ground.
\par 
\par As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two
\par were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,
\par as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of
\par discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young
\par woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was
\par no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from
\par the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.
\par 
\par "Citizen Evremonde," she said, touching him with her cold hand. "I am a
\par poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force."
\par 
\par He murmured for answer: "True. I forget what you were accused of?"
\par 
\par "Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it
\par likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
\par like me?"
\par 
\par The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears
\par started from his eyes.
\par 
\par "I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I
\par am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
\par to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
\par Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!"
\par 
\par As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it
\par warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.
\par 
\par "I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?"
\par 
\par "It was. But, I was again taken and condemned."
\par 
\par "If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your
\par hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me
\par more courage."
\par 
\par As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in
\par them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young
\par fingers, and touched his lips.
\par 
\par "Are you dying for him?" she whispered.
\par 
\par "And his wife and child. Hush! Yes."
\par 
\par "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?"
\par 
\par "Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last."
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
\par same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
\par it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.
\par 
\par "Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!"
\par 
\par The papers are handed out, and read.
\par 
\par "Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?"
\par 
\par This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man
\par pointed out.
\par 
\par "Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The
\par Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?"
\par 
\par Greatly too much for him.
\par 
\par "Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?"
\par 
\par This is she.
\par 
\par "Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?"
\par 
\par It is.
\par 
\par "Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English.
\par This is she?"
\par 
\par She and no other.
\par 
\par "Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;
\par something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate.
\par English. Which is he?"
\par 
\par He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.
\par 
\par "Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?"
\par 
\par It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that
\par he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is
\par under the displeasure of the Republic.
\par 
\par "Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the
\par displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window.
\par Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?"
\par 
\par "I am he. Necessarily, being the last."
\par 
\par It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It
\par is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
\par door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the
\par carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it
\par carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to
\par the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its
\par mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of
\par an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.
\par 
\par "Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned."
\par 
\par "One can depart, citizen?"
\par 
\par "One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!"
\par 
\par "I salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!"
\par 
\par These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and
\par looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there
\par is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.
\par 
\par "Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?"
\par asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.
\par 
\par "It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much;
\par it would rouse suspicion."
\par 
\par "Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!"
\par 
\par "The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued."
\par 
\par Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,
\par dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless
\par trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on
\par either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the
\par stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
\par sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our
\par wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing
\par anything but stopping.
\par 
\par Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary
\par farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,
\par avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back
\par by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,
\par no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!
\par the posting-house.
\par 
\par Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in
\par the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it
\par of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible
\par existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and
\par plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count
\par their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.
\par All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
\par far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.
\par 
\par At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left
\par behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and
\par on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with
\par animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their
\par haunches. We are pursued?
\par 
\par "Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!"
\par 
\par "What is it?" asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.
\par 
\par "How many did they say?"
\par 
\par "I do not understand you."
\par 
\par "--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?"
\par 
\par "Fifty-two."
\par 
\par "I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it
\par forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes
\par handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!"
\par 
\par The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and
\par to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,
\par by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help
\par us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.
\par 
\par The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and
\par the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
\par us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XIV. The Knitting Done
\par 
\par 
\par In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
\par Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
\par Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame
\par Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,
\par erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the
\par conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who
\par was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.
\par 
\par "But our Defarge," said Jacques Three, "is undoubtedly a good
\par Republican? Eh?"
\par 
\par "There is no better," the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill
\par notes, "in France."
\par 
\par "Peace, little Vengeance," said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with
\par a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, "hear me speak. My husband,
\par fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved
\par well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has
\par his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor."
\par 
\par "It is a great pity," croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,
\par with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; "it is not quite like a good
\par citizen; it is a thing to regret."
\par 
\par "See you," said madame, "I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear
\par his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to
\par me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and
\par child must follow the husband and father."
\par 
\par "She has a fine head for it," croaked Jacques Three. "I have seen blue
\par eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held
\par them up." Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.
\par 
\par Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.
\par 
\par "The child also," observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment
\par of his words, "has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child
\par there. It is a pretty sight!"
\par 
\par "In a word," said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,
\par "I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since
\par last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;
\par but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,
\par and then they might escape."
\par 
\par "That must never be," croaked Jacques Three; "no one must escape. We
\par have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day."
\par 
\par "In a word," Madame Defarge went on, "my husband has not my reason for
\par pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for
\par regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,
\par therefore. Come hither, little citizen."
\par 
\par The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the
\par submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.
\par 
\par "Touching those signals, little citizen," said Madame Defarge, sternly,
\par "that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them
\par this very day?"
\par 
\par "Ay, ay, why not!" cried the sawyer. "Every day, in all weathers, from
\par two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes
\par without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes."
\par 
\par He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental
\par imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
\par never seen.
\par 
\par "Clearly plots," said Jacques Three. "Transparently!"
\par 
\par "There is no doubt of the Jury?" inquired Madame Defarge, letting her
\par eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.
\par 
\par "Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my
\par fellow-Jurymen."
\par 
\par "Now, let me see," said Madame Defarge, pondering again. "Yet once more!
\par Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can
\par I spare him?"
\par 
\par "He would count as one head," observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.
\par "We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think."
\par 
\par "He was signalling with her when I saw her," argued Madame Defarge; "I
\par cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and
\par trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a
\par bad witness."
\par 
\par The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent
\par protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
\par witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a
\par celestial witness.
\par 
\par "He must take his chance," said Madame Defarge. "No, I cannot spare
\par him! You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of
\par to-day executed.--You?"
\par 
\par The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in
\par the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
\par of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
\par Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
\par smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
\par barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been
\par suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
\par him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small individual fears
\par for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.
\par 
\par "I," said madame, "am equally engaged at the same place. After it is
\par over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we
\par will give information against these people at my Section."
\par 
\par The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
\par citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded
\par her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and
\par hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.
\par 
\par Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to
\par the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:
\par 
\par "She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will
\par be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the
\par justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
\par I will go to her."
\par 
\par "What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!" exclaimed Jacques
\par Three, rapturously. "Ah, my cherished!" cried The Vengeance; and
\par embraced her.
\par 
\par "Take you my knitting," said Madame Defarge, placing it in her
\par lieutenant's hands, "and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep
\par me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
\par greater concourse than usual, to-day."
\par 
\par "I willingly obey the orders of my Chief," said The Vengeance with
\par alacrity, and kissing her cheek. "You will not be late?"
\par 
\par "I shall be there before the commencement."
\par 
\par "And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul," said
\par The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the
\par street, "before the tumbrils arrive!"
\par 
\par Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and
\par might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the
\par mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the
\par Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative
\par of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.
\par 
\par There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
\par disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded
\par than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a
\par strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great
\par determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
\par to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an
\par instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have
\par heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood
\par with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,
\par opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without
\par pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of
\par her.
\par 
\par It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
\par his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that
\par his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was
\par insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and
\par her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made
\par hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had
\par been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
\par she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had
\par been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any
\par softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
\par sent her there.
\par 
\par Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly
\par worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her
\par dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her
\par bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
\par dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
\par a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
\par walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
\par sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.
\par 
\par Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment
\par waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,
\par the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's
\par attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,
\par but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
\par it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their
\par escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.
\par Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross
\par and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at
\par three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.
\par Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,
\par passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in
\par advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
\par of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.
\par 
\par Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
\par pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had
\par beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had
\par passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding
\par their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,
\par taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
\par else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.
\par 
\par "Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose agitation
\par was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:
\par "what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another
\par carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
\par suspicion."
\par 
\par "My opinion, miss," returned Mr. Cruncher, "is as you're right. Likewise
\par wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong."
\par 
\par "I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures," said
\par Miss Pross, wildly crying, "that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are
\par _you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?"
\par 
\par "Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss," returned Mr. Cruncher, "I
\par hope so. Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o'
\par mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o'
\par two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
\par crisis?"
\par 
\par "Oh, for gracious sake!" cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, "record
\par them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man."
\par 
\par "First," said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with
\par an ashy and solemn visage, "them poor things well out o' this, never no
\par more will I do it, never no more!"
\par 
\par "I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher," returned Miss Pross, "that you
\par never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it
\par necessary to mention more particularly what it is."
\par 
\par "No, miss," returned Jerry, "it shall not be named to you. Second: them
\par poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with
\par Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!"
\par 
\par "Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be," said Miss Pross,
\par striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, "I have no doubt it
\par is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own
\par superintendence.--O my poor darlings!"
\par 
\par "I go so far as to say, miss, moreover," proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a
\par most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--"and let my words
\par be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my
\par opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only
\par hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present
\par time."
\par 
\par "There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man," cried the distracted
\par Miss Pross, "and I hope she finds it answering her expectations."
\par 
\par "Forbid it," proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,
\par additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
\par out, "as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my
\par earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn't all
\par flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here dismal
\par risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!" This was Mr. Cruncher's
\par conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.
\par 
\par And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
\par nearer and nearer.
\par 
\par "If we ever get back to our native land," said Miss Pross, "you may rely
\par upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and
\par understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events
\par you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
\par earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.
\par Cruncher, let us think!"
\par 
\par Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer
\par and nearer.
\par 
\par "If you were to go before," said Miss Pross, "and stop the vehicle and
\par horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't
\par that be best?"
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.
\par 
\par "Where could you wait for me?" asked Miss Pross.
\par 
\par Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
\par Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame
\par Defarge was drawing very near indeed.
\par 
\par "By the cathedral door," said Miss Pross. "Would it be much out of
\par the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
\par towers?"
\par 
\par "No, miss," answered Mr. Cruncher.
\par 
\par "Then, like the best of men," said Miss Pross, "go to the posting-house
\par straight, and make that change."
\par 
\par "I am doubtful," said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,
\par "about leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen."
\par 
\par "Heaven knows we don't," returned Miss Pross, "but have no fear for me.
\par Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can,
\par and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain
\par of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives
\par that may depend on both of us!"
\par 
\par This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty
\par clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he
\par immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself
\par to follow as she had proposed.
\par 
\par The having originated a precaution which was already in course of
\par execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing
\par her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
\par streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty
\par minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.
\par 
\par Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
\par rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
\par in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,
\par which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she
\par could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
\par dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
\par was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
\par out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.
\par 
\par The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of
\par Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,
\par those feet had come to meet that water.
\par 
\par Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, "The wife of Evremonde;
\par where is she?"
\par 
\par It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open,
\par and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were
\par four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before
\par the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.
\par 
\par Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,
\par and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful
\par about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,
\par of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different
\par way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.
\par 
\par "You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer," said Miss
\par Pross, in her breathing. "Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of
\par me. I am an Englishwoman."
\par 
\par Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of
\par Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,
\par hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a
\par woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that
\par Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well
\par that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.
\par 
\par "On my way yonder," said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of
\par her hand towards the fatal spot, "where they reserve my chair and my
\par knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I
\par wish to see her."
\par 
\par "I know that your intentions are evil," said Miss Pross, "and you may
\par depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them."
\par 
\par Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words;
\par both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what
\par the unintelligible words meant.
\par 
\par "It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
\par moment," said Madame Defarge. "Good patriots will know what that means.
\par Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?"
\par 
\par "If those eyes of yours were bed-winches," returned Miss Pross, "and I
\par was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me. No,
\par you wicked foreign woman; I am your match."
\par 
\par Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
\par detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
\par at naught.
\par 
\par "Woman imbecile and pig-like!" said Madame Defarge, frowning. "I take no
\par answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand
\par to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!"
\par This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.
\par 
\par "I little thought," said Miss Pross, "that I should ever want to
\par understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,
\par except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any
\par part of it."
\par 
\par Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes. Madame
\par Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross
\par first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.
\par 
\par "I am a Briton," said Miss Pross, "I am desperate. I don't care an
\par English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the
\par greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I'll not leave a handful of that
\par dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!"
\par 
\par Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
\par between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
\par Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.
\par 
\par But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
\par irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame
\par Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. "Ha, ha!" she
\par laughed, "you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that
\par Doctor." Then she raised her voice and called out, "Citizen Doctor! Wife
\par of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool,
\par answer the Citizeness Defarge!"
\par 
\par Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
\par expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
\par either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.
\par Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.
\par 
\par "Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there
\par are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind
\par you! Let me look."
\par 
\par "Never!" said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as
\par Madame Defarge understood the answer.
\par 
\par "If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
\par brought back," said Madame Defarge to herself.
\par 
\par "As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are
\par uncertain what to do," said Miss Pross to herself; "and you shall not
\par know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know
\par that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you."
\par 
\par "I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
\par I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door," said
\par Madame Defarge.
\par 
\par "We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are
\par not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,
\par while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
\par my darling," said Miss Pross.
\par 
\par Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the
\par moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.
\par It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,
\par with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
\par clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
\par that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her
\par face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and
\par clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.
\par 
\par Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled
\par waist. "It is under my arm," said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, "you
\par shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold
\par you till one or other of us faints or dies!"
\par 
\par Madame Defarge's hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw
\par what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
\par alone--blinded with smoke.
\par 
\par All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
\par stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
\par whose body lay lifeless on the ground.
\par 
\par In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the
\par body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
\par fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of
\par what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to
\par go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to
\par get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,
\par out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking
\par away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
\par and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.
\par 
\par By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have
\par gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she
\par was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
\par like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of
\par gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her
\par dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a
\par hundred ways.
\par 
\par In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving
\par at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,
\par she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if
\par it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains
\par discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and
\par charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the
\par escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.
\par 
\par "Is there any noise in the streets?" she asked him.
\par 
\par "The usual noises," Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the
\par question and by her aspect.
\par 
\par "I don't hear you," said Miss Pross. "What do you say?"
\par 
\par It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could
\par not hear him. "So I'll nod my head," thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, "at
\par all events she'll see that." And she did.
\par 
\par "Is there any noise in the streets now?" asked Miss Pross again,
\par presently.
\par 
\par Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.
\par 
\par "I don't hear it."
\par 
\par "Gone deaf in an hour?" said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind
\par much disturbed; "wot's come to her?"
\par 
\par "I feel," said Miss Pross, "as if there had been a flash and a crash,
\par and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life."
\par 
\par "Blest if she ain't in a queer condition!" said Mr. Cruncher, more and
\par more disturbed. "Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up?
\par Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?"
\par 
\par "I can hear," said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, "nothing. O,
\par my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,
\par and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
\par broken any more as long as my life lasts."
\par 
\par "If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their
\par journey's end," said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, "it's my
\par opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world."
\par 
\par And indeed she never did.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever
\par 
\par 
\par Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six
\par tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and
\par insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,
\par are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in
\par France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,
\par a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under
\par conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush
\par humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will
\par twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of
\par rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield
\par the same fruit according to its kind.
\par 
\par Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what
\par they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
\par the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
\par toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's
\par house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!
\par No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
\par of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. "If thou be changed
\par into this shape by the will of God," say the seers to the enchanted, in
\par the wise Arabian stories, "then remain so! But, if thou wear this
\par form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!"
\par Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.
\par 
\par As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up
\par a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces
\par are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.
\par So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that
\par in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the
\par hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in
\par the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;
\par then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a
\par curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to
\par tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.
\par 
\par Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
\par things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with
\par a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with
\par drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so
\par heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
\par they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,
\par and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and
\par he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made
\par drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole
\par number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.
\par 
\par There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
\par and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some
\par question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is
\par always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The
\par horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
\par their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands
\par at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a
\par mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has
\par no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the
\par girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised
\par against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he
\par shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily
\par touch his face, his arms being bound.
\par 
\par On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands
\par the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.
\par He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, "Has he
\par sacrificed me?" when his face clears, as he looks into the third.
\par 
\par "Which is Evremonde?" says a man behind him.
\par 
\par "That. At the back there."
\par 
\par "With his hand in the girl's?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par The man cries, "Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!
\par Down, Evremonde!"
\par 
\par "Hush, hush!" the Spy entreats him, timidly.
\par 
\par "And why not, citizen?"
\par 
\par "He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
\par Let him be at peace."
\par 
\par But the man continuing to exclaim, "Down, Evremonde!" the face of
\par Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees the
\par Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.
\par 
\par The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the
\par populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and
\par end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and
\par close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following
\par to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of
\par public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the
\par fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.
\par 
\par "Therese!" she cries, in her shrill tones. "Who has seen her? Therese
\par Defarge!"
\par 
\par "She never missed before," says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.
\par 
\par "No; nor will she miss now," cries The Vengeance, petulantly. "Therese."
\par 
\par "Louder," the woman recommends.
\par 
\par Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear
\par thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
\par it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,
\par lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread
\par deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
\par enough to find her!
\par 
\par "Bad Fortune!" cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, "and
\par here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and
\par she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for
\par her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!"
\par 
\par As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils
\par begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are
\par robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who
\par scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
\par think and speak, count One.
\par 
\par The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And
\par the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.
\par 
\par The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next
\par after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but
\par still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the
\par crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into
\par his face and thanks him.
\par 
\par "But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am
\par naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been
\par able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might
\par have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by
\par Heaven."
\par 
\par "Or you to me," says Sydney Carton. "Keep your eyes upon me, dear child,
\par and mind no other object."
\par 
\par "I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let
\par it go, if they are rapid."
\par 
\par "They will be rapid. Fear not!"
\par 
\par The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as
\par if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to
\par heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart
\par and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home
\par together, and to rest in her bosom.
\par 
\par "Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I
\par am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little."
\par 
\par "Tell me what it is."
\par 
\par "I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I
\par love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a
\par farmer's house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows
\par nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I
\par tell her! It is better as it is."
\par 
\par "Yes, yes: better as it is."
\par 
\par "What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still
\par thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so
\par much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor,
\par and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may
\par live a long time: she may even live to be old."
\par 
\par "What then, my gentle sister?"
\par 
\par "Do you think:" the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
\par endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:
\par "that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land
\par where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?"
\par 
\par "It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there."
\par 
\par "You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the
\par moment come?"
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.
\par The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than
\par a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before
\par him--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.
\par 
\par "I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
\par in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
\par believeth in me shall never die."
\par 
\par The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing
\par on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells
\par forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.
\par Twenty-Three.
\par 
\par         *****
\par 
\par They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the
\par peacefullest man's face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked
\par sublime and prophetic.
\par 
\par One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked
\par at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to
\par write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any
\par utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:
\par 
\par "I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge,
\par long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
\par the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease
\par out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
\par rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in
\par their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil
\par of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
\par birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.
\par 
\par "I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful,
\par prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see
\par Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father,
\par aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his
\par healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their
\par friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he has, and passing
\par tranquilly to his reward.
\par 
\par "I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of
\par their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping
\par for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their
\par course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know
\par that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul,
\par than I was in the souls of both.
\par 
\par "I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man
\par winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him
\par winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the
\par light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him,
\par fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,
\par with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to
\par look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement--and I hear him
\par tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.
\par 
\par "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a
\par far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."

\par Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
\par 
\par Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
\par electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
\par including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
\par because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
\par people in all walks of life.
\par 
\par Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
\par assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
\par goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
\par remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
\par Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
\par and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
\par To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
\par and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
\par and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

\par Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
\par Literary Archive Foundation
\par 
\par Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
\par spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
\par increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
\par freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
\par array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
\par ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
\par status with the IRS.
\par 
\par The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
\par charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
\par States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
\par considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
\par with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
\par where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
\par SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
\par particular state visit http://pglaf.org
\par 
\par While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
\par have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
\par against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
\par approach us with offers to donate.
\par 
\par International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
\par any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
\par outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
\par 
\par Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
\par methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
\par ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
\par To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

\par Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
\par works.
\par 
\par Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
\par concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
\par with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
\par Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
\par 
\par 
\par Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
\par editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
\par unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
\par keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
\par 
\par 
\par Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
\par 
\par      http://www.gutenberg.org
\par 
\par This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
\par including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
\par Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
\par subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2\insrsid10955013
